    <h2 id="section1" class="text-centered"> Preface </h2>
    <h3 class="text-centered">Welcome to the World’s First <br> Collaborative Book</h3>
      <p class="first-p">In an interview in year 2000 (p.16), Davis mentions the edition of a book with Printed Matter that would gather the content of <i>The Sentence</i> and would be titled <i>The World’s First Collaborative Book</i>. That book was never published, so I took the liberty of borrowing the title and designing my own version of it.</p>
      <p>When I started working with <i>The World’s First Collaborative Sentence</i> I realized its magnitude and complexity, and that the only possible way to get the text on paper (in a single volume) would be through a radical intervention. Specifically, two interventions, one automatic and other manual.</p>
      <p>First of all it was the technology itself what decided which text was the fundamental one, which parts were worth printing and which could be discarded. No complex software was needed, just the AutoSummarize function, present in most word processors, adjusting the minimum parameters. The second part consisted of a manual review to make sure it was readable and still made some sense, and to delete any dots that might have been generated.</p>
      <p>Otherwise the text has not been altered any further, spelling mistakes and “politically incorrect” messages are still present and I do not take any responsibility.</p>
      <p>I invite the readers to manipulate it (again), <span class="james-underline">underline the parts you feel identified with</span>, the messages that captivate you, the languages you recognize, write in the margins. You can do a linear reading or open it to any page and read a random fragment. </p>
      <p class="james">All notes in blue are left by <a class="james-link" href="https://twitter.com/jhancock532">James Hancock</a>. I'm collaborating with the original author via a pull request to the book's <a class="james-link" href="https://github.com/e-aortiz/collaborative-book">GitHub repository</a>. I felt the title "The World's First Collaborative Book" wouldn't make much sense if nobody else in the world contributed to its binding.</p>
      <p class="last-p">(This book is only a part of the project, at the end of it I briefly explain how you can print your own version, with the parts of the original text discarded or your own words)</p>

    <h2 id="section1.1" class="text-centered"> Prólogo </h2>
    <h3 class="text-centered">Welcome to the World’s First <br> Collaborative Book</h3>
      <p class="first-p">En una entrevista del año 2000 (p.16), Davis menciona la edición de un libro con la editorial Printed Matter que recogería el contenido de <i>The Sentence</i> y se titularía <i>The World’s First Collaborative Book</i>. Dicho libro nunca se llegó a publicar, por lo que me he tomado la libertad de coger prestado el título y diseñar mi propia versión del mismo.</p>
      <p>Cuando empecé a trabajar con <i>The World’s First Collaborative Sentence</i> me di cuenta de su magnitud y complejidad, y de que la única forma posible de llevar ese texto al papel en un único tomo sería a través de una intervención radical. Concretamente dos intervenciones, una automática y otra manual.</p>
      <p>En primer lugar fue la propia tecnología la que decidió qué texto era el fundamental, qué partes merecían ser impresas y cuales podían ser descartadas. No fue necesario ningún software complejo, tan solo ejecutar la función AutoSummarize, presente en la mayoría de procesadores de texto, ajustando los parámetros mínimos. La segunda parte consistió en una revisión manual para cerciorarme de que era legible y todavía conservaba algo de sentido, y para borrar los puntos que se hubieran podido generar.</p>
      <p>Por lo demás, el texto no ha sufrido más alteraciones, las faltas ortográficas y los mensajes “políticamente incorrectos” están todavía presentes y no me hago en ningún caso responsable.</p>
      <p>Invito a los/as lectores/as a su manipulación (otra más), subraya las partes con las que te sientas idenfiticado/a, los mensajes que te cautiven, los idiomas que reconozcas, escribe en los márgenes. Puedes realizar una lectura lineal o bien abrirlo por cualquier página y leer un fragmento al azar.</p>
      <p class="james">No hablo español :( ¡Perdón!</p>
      <p class="last-p">(Este libro es solo una parte del proyecto, al final del mismo explico brevemente cómo puedes imprimir tu propia versión, con las partes del texto original descartadas o tus propias palabras)</p>

    <h2 class="hid">About DD</h2>
    <h2 id="section2" class="text-centered"> Douglas Davis</h2>
    <h3 class="text-centered">The Net Art pioneer</h3>
    <p class="first-p">Douglas Davis (Washington, 1933 - New York, 2014) was an artist, critic, writer and university professor. He is known as a pioneer of video art, the “long-distance art” and author of one of the germinal works of Net Art.</p>
    <p>Davis used technology as a medium to explore new forms of interpersonal communication through screens, first the television and later the computer. He was especially interested in simultaneity, in breaking the temporal and spatial gaps, in creating connections between individuals across time and space. For this reason, in his first works, live performances are of great importance.</p>
    <p>He was interested in the ability of television to connect people over distance. With the emergence of the web, his utopian belief in the possibility of intimacy through communication networks continued.</p>
    <p>Davis also collaborated with the Fluxus group. In 1977, together with Joseph Beuys and Nam June Paik, they created the first live global satellite broadcast of videoart for Documenta 6, <i>The Last Nine Minutes</i>. Anticipating the era of shared knowledge, the three artists allowed the free reproduction of the work.</p>
    <p>In <i>The World’s First Collaborative Sentence</i>, for the first time he establishes a truly interactive dialogue with the audience through the Web, asking them to participate in his speech. Visitors could enter words and links, but could not insert a dot, so the sentence would remain forever.</p>
    <p>Aside his artistic career it is worth talking about his activity as a teacher (he taught in more than 25 universities), critic in Newsweek magazine, and writer of numerous theoretical texts, among which the book <i>Art and the Future</i>, the essays <i>The Five Myths of TV Power (or, Why the Medium is Not the Message)</i> and <i>The Work of Art in the Age of Digital Reproduction (An Evolving Thesis: 1991-1995)</i> stand out.</p>

    <h2 id="section2.1" class="text-centered"> Douglas Davis</h2>
    <h3 class="text-centered">el precursor del Net Art</h3>
    <p class="first-p">Douglas Davis (Washington, 1933 - Nueva York, 2014) fue artista, crítico, escritor y profesor universitario. Conocido como precursor del videoarte, el “long-distance art“ y autor de una de las obras germinales del Net Art.</p>
    <p>Utilizó la tecnología para explorar nuevas formas de comunicación interpersonal a través de las pantallas, primero la del televisor y más tarde la del ordenador. Le interesaba especialmente la simultaneidad, romper las brechas temporales y espaciales, crear conexiones entre individuos a través del tiempo y el espacio. En sus primeras obras tiene una gran importancia el directo.</p>
    <p>Le interesaba la capacidad de la televisión para conectar a la gente en la distancia. Con la aparición de la Web, su creencia utópica en la posibilidad de la intimidad a través de las redes de comunicación no hizo más que crecer.</p>
    <p>Davis también colaboró con el grupo Fluxus. En 1977, junto con Joseph Beuys y Nam June Paik, crearon la primera emisión por satélite de videoarte en directo para Documenta 6, <i>The Last Nine Minutes</i>. Anticipándose a la era del conocimiento compartido, los tres artistas permitieron la libre reproducción de la pieza.</p>
    <p>En <i>The World’s First Collaborative Sentence</i>, por primera vez establece un diálogo totalmente interactivo con la audiencia a través de la Web, pidiéndoles que participen en su obra. Los visitantes podían introducir palabras y enlaces, pero no podían insertar un punto, así la frase continuaría eternamente.</p>
    <p>A su faceta artística hay que sumarle su actividad como docente (impartió clases en más de 25 universidades), crítico en la revista Newsweek, y escritor de numerosos textos teóricos, entre los que destacan el libro <i>‘Art and the Future’ y los ensayos </i>‘The Five Myths of TV Power’ (or, Why the Medium is Not the Message)</i> y <i>‘The Work of Art in the Age of Digital Reproduction’ (An Evolving Thesis: 1991-1995).</i></p>

    <h2 class="hid">About 'The Sentence'</h2>
    <h2 id="section3" class="text-centered" style="margin-bottom: -5pt;">The Sentence</h2>

    <p class="first-p"><i>The World’s First Collaborative Sentence</i> by Douglas Davis was commissioned by the Lehman College Art Gallery in 1994 for the exhibition “InterActions”, featuring Gary Welz, Robert Schneider and Susan Hoeltzel. It was one of the first examples of interactive computer art and attracted 200,000 contributions from around the world between 1994 and 2000.</p>
    <p>Although acquired by the Whitney Museum in 1995, the piece remained on the Lehman College website until 2005. The work was donated to the Whitney by Barbara Schwartz, in honor of her late husband, Eugene M. Schwartz.</p>
    <p>In early 2012, the Whitney Museum embarked on a conservation effort with a team led by Carol Mancusi-Ungaro and Christiane Paul, in coordination with Farris Wahbeh, Ben Fino-Radin —Rhizome’s digital conservator—, and the museum’s Digital Media department.</p>
    <p><span class="note" footnote="‒ Ryzik, Malena. (Jun 9, 2013). When Artworks Crash: Restorers Face Digital Test. The New York Times.">In June 2013, <i>The New York Times</i> published an article on the restoration, addressing the ethical and theoretical issues that the team faced. When a digital artwork becomes technologically obsolete, can software upgrades radically change the piece?</span></p>
    <p>When the Whitney’s curators decided to resurrect the piece, it no longer worked. Once innovative, it now collapsed browsers. The code was rudimentary, the links were outdated, there was endless scrolling and indecipherable text. Davis, who was 80 years old at the time, could not participate in the consultations about the reconstruction of his piece and, without him, the meetings became a conceptual debate.</p>
    <p>The team considered several options. One of them was to let technological extinction take its course, see Net Art as ephemeral art and leave the broken links as a testimony to the Web and its rapid development.</p>
    <p>However, the solution they came up with was to duplicate the original installation and create another updated version to which they could continue to contribute.</p>
    <p><span class="note" footnote="‒ Connor, Michael. (Jun 12, 2013). Restoring ‘The World’s First Collaborative Sentence’. Rhizome.">Three days after the publication of the NYT article, <i>Rhizome</i>, the New York digital art platform, also joined in narrating the process, focusing in this case on the technological difficulties they faced.</span></p>
    <p>The Whitney had to deal with several serious technical problems. The work was shown as part of the first Gwangju Biennale in 1995 in a new media pavilion dedicated to Nam June Paik, where several visitors contributed using Korean characters.</p>
    <p>The CGI script that allowed visitors to enter text was lost and had to be reconstructed based on information gathered in interviews with the original programmer. Furthermore, due to coding damage, none of the texts entered in Hangul were readable. All efforts made by the museum to recover that text failed, and although a <span class="james"><a class="james-link" href="https://github.com/whitneymuseum/douglas-davis">GitHub repository</a></span> was opened so that anyone could help in its recovery, it seems almost impossible. </p> 
    <p><span class="james">(The repository has received six forks and stars over the past 8 years. It doesn't seem like anyone has made a considered effort into the matter beyond the original researchers.)</p>
    <p>The conclusion reached by both articles is that the project is an excellent case study on digital preservation issues. Net Art degrades much faster than traditional visual art, and maintenance demands are much higher, so conservation practices must be continually updated to be effective.</p>
    <p>Currently, in 2021, the links to the piece are still active on the Whitney’s website, although both versions converge and it is not possible to distinguish which part of the sentence belongs to which timeline, or <span class="james">how</span> to participate in it.</p>

    <p class="white" style="margin-top: 50pt;">TB: Do you think that the internet has accomplished what you were aiming at with your performances?</p>
    <p class="white">DD: Yes. It is the ultimate means of getting really intense response, and hearing from people. With works like "The World's Longest Sentence", it is a way of getting people actively involved in the creation of something. I am still absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of people who come onto it and what they do. Then again: Down with mediums! Down with the Web! Up with...you!</p>
    <p class="white">TB: But how "interactive" is it to add to a sentence that nobody will ever read?</p>
    <p class="white">DD: But people do read the sentence. When we make a book out of it, more people will read it. If you spend a lot of time adding to the sentence, you can be sure that you tell lots of friends about it. If you read the sentence you get a sense of the interaction that is going on between people. There are different subjects and themes that persist: the linguistic nature of this thing (is it a real sentence?), loneliness, words as lifelines, time, space, love, lust, art, poetry, politics.</p>
    <p class="white">There is also a certain amount of personal revelation going on. It’s certainly much deeper than the usual shit that goes on on chat lines. People reveal things about themselves, about watching their parents die or horrible break ups of relationships or problems with the police. There is a lot of heavy stuff going on. Then there is also a lot of humour, gaming, word play and things like that.</p>

    <span class="page-break"></span>

    <p class="white" style="margin-top: 80pt;">JT:  What is your opinion of contemporary artists who are seeking to become the first pioneers of Biotech and Nanotech? Do you feel that they will have the same spirit as yourself when you become the first in Telecommunications art?</p>
    <p class="white">DD: Yes and No. The politics are gone. And the idea of being First, of doing something nobody else has ever done before, is now highly active throughout our entire society, in medicine, commerce, telecommunications, the digital industry, sexuality. NOW EVERYONE WANTS TO BE FIRST AT SOMETHING. As a Quantum man, I applaud it. The universe is just beginning…</p>
    <p class="white">JT:  Are you actively interested in the increasing trajectory towards video-game environments (avatars and bots) and software emulation as an art-form?</p>
    <p class="white">DD: Sure. I am interested in anything that extends me… into you… into another state… beyond where I am now.</p>
    <p class="white">JT: Do you have any advice for online artists of today's generation?</p>
    <p class="white">DD: GO, GO, GO, AS FAR AND AS FAST AS YOU CAN… BUT BRING SOMEONE ALONG WITH YOU.</p>
    <p class="white james-dark"> BRING SOMEONE ALONG WITH YOU. <br> (Repetition added by James for emphasis)</p>

    <h2 class="hid">Sobre 'The Sentence'</h2>
    <h2 id="section3.1" class="text-centered" style="margin-bottom: -5pt;">The Sentence</h2>

    <p class="first-p"><i>The World’s First Collaborative Sentence</i> de Douglas Davis fue comisionada por la Lehman College Art Gallery en 1994 para la exposición “InterActions”, con la intervención de Gary Welz, Robert Schneider y Susan Hoeltzel. Fue uno de los primeros ejemplos de arte computacional interactivo y atrajo 200.000 contribuciones de todo el mundo entre 1994 y 2000.</p>
    <p>Aunque fue adquirida por el Museo Whitney en 1995, la pieza se mantuvo en la web del Lehman College hasta 2005. La obra fue donada al Whitney por Barbara Schwartz, en honor a Eugene M. Schwartz, su difunto marido.</p>
    <p>A principios de 2012 el Museo Whitney acometió un intento de conservación de la obra, con un equipo encabezado por Carol Mancusi-Ungaro y Christiane Paul, en coordinación con Farris Wahbeh, Ben Fino-Radin —conservador digital de Rhizome—, y el departamento de Medios Digitales del museo.</p>
    <p><span class="note" footnote="‒ Ryzik, Malena. (Jun 9, 2013). When Artworks Crash: Restorers Face Digital Test. The New York Times.">En junio de 2013, el <i>New York Times</i> publicó un artículo sobre la restauración, abordando las cuestiones éticas y teóricas a las que se enfrentó el equipo. Cuando una obra de arte digital se vuelve tecnológicamente obsoleta, puede la actualización del software cambiar radicalmente la pieza?</span></p>
    <p>Cuando los curadores del Whitney decidieron resucitar la pieza, ya no funcionaba. Antes innovadora, ahora colapsaba los navegadores. El código era rudimentario, los enlaces estaban desactualizados, había un desplazamiento interminable y texto indescifrable. Davis, que en ese momento tenía 80 años, no pudo participar en las consultas sobre la reconstrucción de su pieza y, sin él, las reuniones se convirtieron en un debate conceptual.</p>
    <p>El equipo consideró varias opciones. Una de ellas era dejar que la extinción tecnológica siguiera su curso, ver el Net Art como arte efímero y dejar los enlaces rotos como testimonio de la Web y su rápido desarrollo. Sin embargo, la solución a la que llegaron fue la de duplicar la instalación original y crear otra versión actualizada a la que se pudiera seguir contribuyendo.</p>
    <p><span class="note" footnote="‒ Connor, Michael. (Jun 12, 2013). Restoring ‘The World’s First Collaborative Sentence’. Rhizome.">Tres días después de la publicación del artículo del NYT, <i>Rhizome</i>, la plataforma neoyorquina de arte digital, se unió también a narrar el proceso, centrándose en este caso en las dificultades tecnológicas.</span></p>
    <p>El Whitney tuvo que lidiar con varios problemas técnicos serios. La obra se mostró como parte de la primera Bienal de Gwangju en 1995, en un pabellón de nuevos medios de comunicación dedicado a Nam June Paik, en el que varios visitantes contribuyeron utilizando caracteres coreanos. El script CGI que permitía a los visitantes introducir el texto se perdió y tuvo que ser reconstruido en base a la información recogida en entrevistas con el programador original. Además, debido a un daño en la codificación, ninguno de los textos introducidos en hangul era legible. Todos los esfuerzos por parte del museo para recuperar ese texto resultaron fallidos, y aunque se llegó a abrir un GitHub para que cualquiera pudiera ayudar a su recuperación, parece misión imposible.</p>
    <p>La conclusión a la que llegan ambos artículos es que el proyecto es un excelente caso de estudio sobre las cuestiones relacionadas con la conservación digital. El Net Art se degrada mucho más rápido que el arte visual tradicional, y las demandas de mantenimiento son mucho mayores, por ello las prácticas de conservación deben actualizarse continuamente para resultar eficaces.</p>
    <p>Actualmente, en 2021, los enlaces siguen activos en la web del Whitney, aunque ambas versiones confluyen y no es posible distinguir qué parte de la frase pertenece a qué línea temporal ni participar en ella.</p>

And of course, there, alone on a bench as the moon sunk, I sat, the darkness engulfing me in my little boat as the lake rippled around me, fish leaping, frogs croaking in the dark early morn, and still I was there, alone on a large vast sea of metaphorical water, waiting for the sun to rise and shed some light on me, the fish, the frog, the boat and the lake And of course, there, alone on a bench as the moon sunk, I sat, the darkness engulfing me in my little boat as the lake rippled around me, fish leaping, frogs croaking in the dark early morn, and still I was there, alone on a large vast sea of metaphorical water, waiting for the sun to rise and shed some light on me, the fish, the frog, the boat and the lake THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN FROM BOMBAY ON A SLOW BOAT TO CHINA ONE DAY WAS TRAPPED IN THE TILLER BY A SEX CRAZED GORILLA AND CHINA’S A LONG WAY AWAY And down went the bucket into the subconscious, BELIEVE IT IF YOU NEED IT / IF YOU DON’T JUST / PASS IT ON so the thing occurred to me that if I cut off my foot people might respect me more or at least pay attention to me limping down the highway or perhaps an eye missing and an eye patch like some Napoleonic hero with a sword rusted from continental wars and a sash of Chinese silk as red as the lips of a country wife cooking sourdough biscuits in the cool afternoon of late summer in the mountains rearing up over the shoulder of the world cool and soft like my cousin Jane that summer on the lake in the late 1950’s though every time I’ve touched someone remains burned into my brain like as I walked down moshoulu parkway, the street of my youth, in my mind while sitting here in new jersey, the idea of the Bronx became more real to me yet again I hear the birds sing their sweet song of indolence as the street sweepers and feral dogs lusted after the twilight softly falling on the street corner CHRIS WAS HERE!

blind traveller labored in their shadow as well as his own having given this some thought I’d have to say that the premise of this piece is off a sentence, according to the 1994 American Heritage dictionary is a noun, a grammatical unit that is syntactically independent and has a subject that is expressed or, as in an imperative sentence, understood and a predicate that contains at least one finite verb now this piece is more like some form of unmutable graffiti that everyone adds his/her presence to this . is a dot it is not a period, it is only a dot only DD can have the pleasure of

imagening all this as the UTTER REALITY is that no man, let alone WOMAN, can help but **shiver** at the pure thought that he lives there although one can hear “But Can it really Be?” -type pondering and “I mean, Oslo, Norway, for Godssakes Wasn’t he born in Rotterdam, Holland?” and as such it is the infinite STUPIDITY of those who hadn’t realized that “Foss, Roger” had moved, since we all HATE to think that fact wasn’t realized when he moved at the age of 9 and then ah well, let us not dwell upon such low creatures that have such low learning capacity, because now is the winter of our

that ever happened, was created by you just tuck it under your cap for a rainy day, my little furry friend, is all that was ever said Mark Twain said something like “Whatever you do, don’t let school get in the way of your education” but then school is a bad subject for me - until I was five years old, I didn’t speak English, only Dakota, at that time, but when I got sent off to boarding school, I learned, boy, I learned fast - I still remember the beatings we got if for one moment a word that wasn’t English slipped out of our mouths - “dirty Indian talk,” it was called - now I can’t speak it but I understand it when someone speaks it to me - I wonder sometimes if I really have lost my ability to speak it - sometimes I wonder if that old fear of those hands, that stick, those whips, is locking my language away somewhere deep in my body - other times I don’t like to think about it, and I try to invent new voices and sometimes they sound like this: much like leaving the train for a quick hitch to the water where there are fish and sharks and all sorts of naughty bits that collide and then hurl their feces into the tracks again like a never ending street car filled with rednecks and puitans who vomit vomit vomit vomit the green hoary vile spew of the church and of the roman baths where, im my humble opinion, the vomiting began when dinner was washed down with wine diluted with water from the nile, natural spring water replete with hair and stern calcium deposits from up river where the silt of the upturned desert runs off into the crystaline springs from deep deep deep deep under, so deep that fish and worms, white and blind, wriggle undisturbed and free along great crevices in an area close to atlantis, but only the atlantis near the core, an atlantis without capitals, seeing as the atlantis with capitalisation has never nor will ever exists, which is to say, it was a land of milk and honey a land never experienced by tongues such as ours: tongues all pink

catching on fire and the maker of the earth rots i the grave that he was burie in since we no longer need him to enrich our lives but some few foolish apes are still trying to swing back and forth in the trees without which we could be on our way mking waves in a giant multi colore worl pool full of fantastic lights lashing back an forth an the power of deep base rythem moving inside out limbs as

wok their asses off for nothing and I am only trying to survive at this point so unhappy with so many things but knowing that there is still a future fo me and I will succeed and I can’t give up hope, this geneation I see growing up around me is one of the miracles o the imagnation a figment lost in twisted illusion an so we all stand stll gain looking out over the railing and a few of us jump off

This is necessarily only a small sample, as I am doing this all from memory, and may therefore have to apologize for various typos to speakers of those languages; I could say a lot more on this subject, but I think that for the time being I shall stop here and post this already, before there’s a power failure or an earthquake or something; thank you for your indulgence Digging for gold, the old man found lint in his pants as he expounded effortlessly for an extended period of time, relinquishing his time for no one, caring not how anyone felt or if they cared at all, mispronouncing words from his discipline just to piss off on-lookers, he was and will forever be, the old coot’s son not that it makes a whole lot of difference anyway, as you’re either reading this for your own entertainment, or more probably you’ve only been _writing_ this for your own entertainment, because somehow I doubt whether many people would take the trouble to read it all in one go, especially the all caps parts which are very hard on the eyes; overigens heb ik er blijkbaar goed aan gedaan naast mijn moedertaal nog enkele andere talen aan het maagdelijke blad (nou ja, het enigszins maagdelijk uitziende edoch in werkelijkheid niet zijnde wegens reeds ontelbare malen uitgewist en hernieuwd zijnde beeldscherm) te slijten, daar een grondigere studie van deze zin mij tot het besef heeft gebracht dat toch enkele nederlandstaligen reeds eerder hun taal aan deze zin hebben toevertrouwd, I think I was still the first with the Finnish anyway, though I wouldn’t be surprised if the first suomalainen to drop by chews me out for omitting the little dots over the vowels, but I plead innocent on that count: I tried it and it didn’t work in French, so I didn’t bother trying it again and again; and the world turns on, and there isn’t a cockroach in any of your kitchens, or a tapeworm in any of your bowels, or a mouse in any of your basements, or a bat in any of your belfries, or a jellyfish on any of your beaches, or a piranha in any of your swimming pools, or an oak tree in any of your gardens, who gives a damn about whether this is really the World’s First Collaborative Sentence, or just a long string of words masquerading as a single sentence by the rather dictatorial expedient of outlawing periods, and of course they’re all entitled to their own opinions, in fact, they not only don’t care, they don’t _know_, but chances are they wouldn’t care even if they knew, which reminds me, incidentally, that it would be impossible to pull this trick in Lojban, where you don’t have to type a period to unambiguously end a sentence There would have been a period right there if this was a dictation, but then of course there is that marvellous invention, the semicolon; which is not only useful for winking ;-) but enables you to punctuate an endless ramble, rant, and rave like this one without having recourse to the poor, much-maligned period; and then there is the exclamation point! Let me just say (nothing) and now pause between the endless longing for endlessness to express the endless longing for less longing for less procreation and more recreation and suddenly Sophie says wow and now this space has cybersubstance for as long as there burns electricity into this circuit which way do we go-please invoke cartoon voice for last phrase and then invoke the spirit of AL GREEN singing LETS STAY TOGETHER and then soak up all the love you can while you still can while I wrap up the text, i dont want to say I dont know what to say, but this is the end (trail of periods) ending in a dower dark dusty doom but nonetheless god so inhibited here i find hope in sunshine & the solicitations of my friends so who are you & why am i let’s just call it expropriation now is the winter

and all the clouds that lowr’d upon this house made to vanish submit button The screen door slams, Mary’s dress waves, like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays, Roy Orbison singing for the lonely, Hey that’s me and I want you only, Don’t turn me home again, I just can’t face myself alone again, Don’t run back inside darling you know just what I’m here for, so you’re scared and you’re thinking maybe that maybe we ain’t that young anymore, show a little faith, there’s magic in the night, you ain’t a beauty but hey you’re alright, oh and that’s alright with me well i can see that there is a lot to take in here those are not periods merely pondering a display of time i have seen a lot of crass crap on net is this HERE a something that is truly organic and owned by us more like the NET itself was and is and probably will not be for more than a small period like this one  i was bemused how SMALL it is this BIIIIG sentence so indeed it does reflect that we begin and end with something VERY small and insignificant sperm & dust so i bid you farewell across the world until i visit this short but long period again from england and then, suddenly, a minutes past, and then another, and then, without warning, another, different minutes past but wait a minnute, hey quit, making desire part of my daily ritual, i walk the streets of my town scanning up and down for the perfect one, the one who on this day would be the object of my desire, to desire to hold, desire to kiss, and plan out what a life would be like with that person in mine just because punya was here too  sadly smita could not make it and I’m Scott from Brady TX and the Internet will become part of the future and everybody will have access and is this really art and hi to you, reader and Stephen King is the best author ever and I’m using Lynx with no graphics ohhhuhhhthisfeelsgood and I wish that if someone is going to write a program called satan to do satan-like things to the world and let us hack and phreak our little heads off then they should at least make it easy to find you know, words are a wonderful form of communication, but they will never replace kisses and punches, so I think, therefore I am, I think the quick brown fox jumped over the dog’s back and the point was that I forgot to tell him how much I loved him, I forgot to tell him how much I appreciate his tenderness, so I am not sure that he ever knew how much it all meant to me, and the point now is to live it more ugently and to be here with my body and yours and to never let it all slip between our fingers and into a virtual world beyond our grasp, but tell me how to not that this is a run on sentence or anything, because I like to see people join up and show our old english teachers that poetic license can be used other places: not only in poems, and if I ever learn how to spell or use punctuation correctly, hey, the world will be a better place  seth, 95 we stumbled across this damn thing as we took drugs and ate Taco Bell fastfood, and we were impressed by the persistence of people, being somewhat persistent people ourselves, as evidenced by these words, which constitute our contribution to this sentence, which I am afraid to say is certainly not the World’s First Collaborative Sentence, since I distinctly remember writing several collaborative sentences with my friend Victor Virgil Vallowe (his real name!) when I was in high school, but of course our sentences tended to be much shorter, anyway, we are putting together a World’s First Thing of our own, namely, the World’s First TV Show on the Net, which may sound really foolish, but you can’t imagine HOW foolish until you see for yourself, which you can, come April 18th, 1995, by searching for ROX yes ROX on the Web, which reminds me, my friend T Black wrote a song called “Fuck” which his band Kernie performed recently, and so I thought I’d share some of his lyrics with you: “Fuck is my favorite word Fuck if you haven’t heard Fuck I say it every day Fuck to keep the doctor away Fuck fuck fuuuuuuck fuck fuckfuckfuck “ and so on like that there, gets a bit tiresome, but that reminds me I now feel part of things I have made my mark there is no point in continuing once you start, your fears go away like the time I was just sitting there thinking about all that had happened to me since I was born because now that I have lived out almost 18 years on this small blue green planet which is just really another ball of molecules revolving around a small star I have come to realize that not much of it matters in the long run except fun, making other people happy, love, REM, and of course sleep, which is just a poor substitue for coffee as any true goth can tell you because yeah thoug I walk through

And so Joe called her to dinner but there was no response at all even considering the fact that the phone had been repaired just three days earlier during that sudden rain storm that flooded the field as well as Joe’s mind with fresh thoughts of life and its meaning which really meant little to Joe Did it really matter that Room 13 wouldn’t be ready for months even though others at the school were enjoying the fruits of new construction not to Joe it didn’t after all he was the one with the phone problems and he still couldn’t get her to dinner ,to which i must add”don’t ever fuck a cop’s wife” Whereas Chuck Jones would follow his own lead by breaking every rule he had strived to master, Avery and Freleng decided to stick to their strengths, instead concentrating on how to better hone the timing and humor of their works, whilst maintaining their foundations. and what can we learn from this boys and girls UNDER THE RUG IS A BAD PLACE TO HIDE A GUN, there is a wolf at the door Just remember, when pondering the world today, or the world of our future, No Matter Where You Go - There You are the answer to the great question of life, the universe and everything is, is, is, 42;

close your eyes and push real hard with your nose up against the first ship in the conga line, and get used to it, ‘cause there’s 999 more left after this one fnord I have nothing to say and I am saying it with this but it is not the reality that places us here, it is the sense of being that defines who and what we are If there were no “us” there would be no reality And if you save you friends, You will make him happy MOM and DAD when to a show, they dropped me off at Grandpa Joe’s I saw a shooting star and I wished on it but I didn’t get my wish to the salvatore: you know, you jusst wouldn’t know what orgasmic screaming is like i find your so-called passion false and shallow your arrogance is no longer amusing we’ve all read the text, we don’t need to hear you read it again you just like to hear the sound of your own voice when something seems to you it probably doesn’t seem to anybody else really really Candy is cool not the kind of candy we eat but the Candy that is sitting at the computer next to me and I bumped her mouse while I was reading this sentence to see what was new and I said sorry and she told me not to apologize and I think that more people should be like that because we don’t really deserve anything oh did you think you deserved something like love or a job because you don’t, you know, and I will keep on saying sorry to Miss Candy because she doesn’t expect me to and now she’s clapping because I told her I’m going to put her in THE SENTENCE but I’ll let her decide I am having a very strange day a very strange day indeed…I AM afraid to say If women were as fun to play with as my basketball I could live as a much happier individual I do appreciate the fact that my parents are wonderful people on the inside it just seems that they are so flaky to the outside world when you consider that my life as a basketball has been so rewarding just the other day i was able to bounce myself right over The walls OH MY GOD THE WALLS PLEASE, make it stop I CAN’T TAKE IT, someone please help me, OH LORD, they’re falling, I cant get out, please, somebody, I can’t hear, WHAT’S HAPPENING TO ME, HELP ME, My eyes, NO, NOT MY EYES TOO, WHY ME, LORD, WHAT HAVE I DONE, can’t anyone hear me, where did you go, THIS ISN’T FAIR, THIS CAN’T BE HAPPENING TO ME, please, make them stop, where are you, I can’t see you, I cant hear you, I feel you, Thank You The walls, OH MY GOD, THE WALLS, PLEASE, make it stop, I CAN’T TAKE IT, someone please help me, OH LORD, they’re falling, I cant get out, please, somebody,I can’t hear, WHAT’S HAPPENING TO ME, HELP ME, My eyes, NO, NOT MY EYES TOO, WHY ME, LORD, WHAT HAVE I DONE, can’t anyone hear me, where did you go, THIS ISN’T FAIR, THIS CAN’T BE HAPPENING TO ME, please, make them stop, where are you, I can’t see you, I cant hear you, I feel you, Thank You but then I had to go off to the market, and the dog, which remained by itself, perished slowly and painfully, but back to where I was before, now, and all that what is that? so here i am sitting on the edge of infinity with one foot in the future and my ass in the present, in a sling, but i can’t help feeling a perverse hope or a song in my soul (though the real question is, do we really have souls, and of course, we don’t find out until the physical body is dead) cynical though i may be i must reserve a section of myself for mysticism, i believe that is important that mysticism must not die with the coming of the hyper-rational age, if you will what i mean by that is the so-called information age, or the technological age, whatever the hell you want to call it we must not let our belief systems die (and i’m not really talking religiously here, though if you want to take it that way that’s fine); no, belief system in the way that we believe in the tooth fairy or santa claus or whatever our imaginations can drag up IMAGINATION MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO WITHER AWAY INTO NOTHINGNESS and that is what i have to say yes we do have souls and we know now because of creativity and imagination and our ability to create things we cannot manage such as the internet or explosives or any kind of art…hello gorgeous i’m a man who’s secretly in love with you; i’ve been watching you day by day, and i can’t hold it in any longer; my passion for you is deep as the sea, my love as vast as the horizon; haven’t you noticed me?

certainly not I, for on the day of seven the truth shall be known: stabler than toothpaste left open, spilt upon rocks not dusty fog until periodic warmth, my name was greg until i found your house back in the trees, dark blue shade of lemonade truth I remember time by the the music, that we were most likely jamming Sly or the Temptations or even Rare Earth, I think their not I’m not going to try to name everyone, most families from around here were represented and maybe a few out of towners too, any way that damn Chevy had a 396 that was nothing but the truth, until we tried to pass that GTO, we were rolling down 43, just out side of Red Oak, happy and raising hell cause we two dollars in our pockets maybe, but Donell pulled out there to pass that GT O and guty driving was not about to give it up, that three nine six never back up, but neither did that GTO we were and did’nt believe we could die, so we enjoyed the ride, it was like hurling down those hills at Uncle Foster house, some how no one crashed into those two pines at the bottom of the old rail, I hope the gold miners that built them were at least that lucky, they did’nt find much gold or they’d still be there, but like I said that Goat would not back up, the 396 with all those young, dumb, reckless, kids was headed up that hill, When the oldest said, “back off man, we ain’t gonna make it,”  somehow we go back on the right side of the road just as we crested the hill a log truck, fully loading was there too in a NandO second, has anyone seen Stella, I’m looking for her, and when the world decides to listen to the wind, it will hear it’s own crying okay okay I never thought I would want to add to this fucking stupid sentance, but here I am I don’t know how I ever got involved it was the maid, it was the butler in the living room with the rope,,,,colonel custard that is all from the west coast - the best coast Pacific Northwest se-a-ul is da shit bumba clat dem shitstem say Peter Tosh the kind brother gotototo go Tornados are coming good I JUST FOUND THIS SENTENCE…the world is now one with itself and other mortal beings, we are the quintessential beings of live - living, prospering, growing on and on and on until one day there may be no more; the end is far however and if that day should ever come the let it be it so and hope and pray and breathe that if it be it so then that is how it was just meant to be and then a hush fell over everything and the man with the oak walking stick cleared his throat, and then blew his nose, and then started hacking real bad, like one of those people who you know shouldn’t be going to those smoke-filled bingo halls, but go night after night and then he spoke, in a clear and high and almost girlish voice and from the dawn of time, we sailed onwards, infinitely up into the heavens hoping only for a glimpse of God, or for proof that he did not in fact exist -wondering if we worshipped the right one, or if he was in fact dwelling inside us all the time- now of course, if he was dwelling inside, was it just one of us, or all of us, and if he was in all of us was he distributed equally, into 5 billion seperate parts of the human condition or, instead did he in fact reside in all of us in his whole form -could we in substance, ourselves, the human race, be this “God” for which we searched, and where is the place for organized religion in all of this, the answer of course to that last part being nowhere at all, no organized religion is without hypocrisy when one simple man speaks to us and tells us he is the messenger of God, so I say unto you, all of you, that we must continue on as we always have, and believe only in ourseleves and our fellow man, and perhaps for the first time we will see the peace to end all wars and then out of the gates of hell the lone man rose to dispute the rantings on of the silly creatures who spout so much nonsense and then he spoke to all who listened and said “Heads will roll”, and the earth swallowed him and the sun shined and the earth shaked as I slowly walked on wondering what the man had meant as I looked to the sky and it turned dark in my face, horrors crossing my eyes as I slowly melted into nothingness sometimes I feel as if I am wasting my life away, so I just change the channel This crazy place in which we now dwell will grow and melt together with other alternate spaces in the widest expanse that the human mind will ever create to form a conglomerate of ideas not from the multitudes but from the infinite multitudes of people who lived then and live now and will live on into the future, the human condition dictates that in the spirit of manifest destiny we will always want to expand our territories into every which realm we dwell whether it be a man made realm or a universal realm and the condition that we have created is that our minds will create new areas in which other minds can create and be godlike, a specific example of this phenonenom is exactly what we are doing right now, submitting entries onto the longest string of human thought and idea to ever be thought of, and if we had not thought of it and added to it as one people “IT” would not exist at all so “IT” is a man made world in which humans can achieve greatness itself, and what could ever be better than that anyway I would like to kill, no maim, no just hurt, no wait, I would like to get my boss fired so I can have his job long live the Great Marmot, he is wise and all-knowing, particularly about sunflower seeds full of benevolence for dogs and little children and i thought that a giant must have scratched his head one day and decided that it was possible for me to exist and here i am walking around in his mind dreading the day he will decide that i am impossible after all but the snow must melt and complete its course down the mountain to the sea where man climbed down from the trees and began diving for oysters out beyond the breakers when the atlantic ocean was narrow enough to step across and before the tribe of eve spread out to conquer the archaic peoples the computer is neither a medium nor a tool in the year 2000,my life will be truly ideal; that is, I will experience a time that I had dreamed of when I was seven years old; I couldn’t imagine living to see that year arrive,yet my son (Michael P Trop) is now seven years old, and my daughter (Alyssa B Trop) will be seven years old in the year 2000, so I will be especially satisfied in that year Fly to fight, fight to fly, fight to win Could it be more simple As long as you keep your goals in sight, you can accomplish anything Work the system, you can do it Always look out for number one, but make sure number one is you Jack and Kate have older siblings (Mark and Laura) and several friends,like Avedon and Colburn (the dogs) and Calahan and Atget (the cats); they live in Saint Paul with Kimo and Kitty who do art and literature stuff--they sort of tolerate it since it doesn’t get in the way very often or at least that’s what Jack says This is the world as we know it LOVE IS ALL AROUND ME man, these people are freeeks and i don’t know what their problem is this is sick that i’m actually adding on to this damned thing but i have nothing better to do and obviously you don’t either else you wouldn’t be sitting her reaing this now would you? Ooh, boy, I love you so, never, ever, ever going to let you go, once I get my hands on you, ooh, boy, I love you so, never, ever, ever going to let you go, I hope you feel the same way too” and

whilst doing so, I’m still overawed by the magnitude of it all, and I’m getting slightly confused about how to continue the sentance without putting in a I haven’t got the will power, I need a to finish the sentance, if I spell it out does that cound, I wonder, no, I’d better not try it, just in case, will I be famous now, probably not, Mark Coleman, he was here, because it’s not worth not having what you really want you reach out and hold that which you know is true and right HI IT IS MAY, 20 1995 AND IJUST WANTED TO SAY HI TO EVERYONE HERE AND THIS LONG SENTENCE IS A PRETTY COOL THING AND I AM PRETTY GLAD THAT I AM ADDING ON TO IT I MEAN ITS NOT A LOT OF TIMES IN YOUR LIFE WHEN YOU GET TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND I HAVE A BROKEN FINGER AND EVERY THING SO IT IS PRETTY HARD TO TYPE AND BY THE WAY DOES ANYONE HERE GO TO PARKSIDE COMMUNITY SCHOOL WELL IF YOU DO TYPE 3434RREETYGH AND I WILL BE WATCHING AND ALSO IF ANY OF YOU FOLKS ARE TEN YEARS OLD TYPE 1122333445RTNVNN PRETTY

FROM YOUR HEART, NOT YOUR HEAD she then reached behind her back and pulled out a knife which she held up to the sunlight to drive a ray of light his eyes This isn’t a sentence it is just lots of sentences with no full stops There are lots of strange people out there I just nevre realised my son Sam will be seven yers,old and I will only be 27 right this minute I am sitting in the library of Newcastle University in England and I have one more week until I am either totally happy or inevitably unhappy most of the time I am unhappy I am an artist and I paint Really noone really understands me as little as I understand anyone else Joe told me the other dat that he had just started taking Prozac and he did not want to go otu with anymore but then we did and it all just goes on My name is Rachel and I am only 22 I’m starting to forget my age already these days and my I have seen some grey hairs i’m bored now and I’m going of course it is, and so as when Dante found himself wandering into the deepest cloaca of the deepest Wood, all seemed lost or at least unrecyclable, and entropy was doing its dirty work upon the face of the earth, chortling in ecstatic epiphany he spoke to himself in the manner of tongues, thus: that now I will invoke a shade to be my alter ego much as Clark Kent, someone holy as Thoreau and classical to boot, to ghost write a major poem, artwork of thought, despite the terrifying sounds off in the woods of creature-cries (Daffy Duck, Rasputin, Bonzo the bear, Zippy the avatar, Ronald MacDonald, Attila the Hun, and Oh so many more), I will “walk this way” placing one foot after the other as they say, never a straight line, with this doppleganger for a guide, into the rabbit hole, up the spiral staircase, out to the diamond stars, though the fourth dimension, and on anon ergo, while i held you in my arms but entropy is’nt a bad thing by itself, in fact the constant influx of solar energy to the planet has allowed life itself to fluorish (i.e. it more than offsets the natural process of entropy, resulting in an increase in order, aka photosynthesis, to balance the increasing disorder, aka decay), so that the overall result is equilibrium; like a car on a hill, when you give it just enough gas to keep it from rolling downhill; the problem is that by interfering with “nature”, for example simplifying the earth’s biota through extinctions of species other than our own, and the few we collectively value (i.e. cattle, dogs, etc.), we have interfered with the process, giving entropy the edge, and as a result, the car is now rolling downhill i love keith marshall! Is’s end of post exploding pimples coat the righteous in a layer of artificial beef When 2000’s near we will all be here to watch and learn and provide, to hope and give, but we must remember that no one must divide when 2000’s near we will all be here to watch and learn and provide, to hope and give, but we must remember that no one must divide Traci Lords to continue, this is a spiffy idea and i have lots to say but not much time just now more to follow later and yet, I believe that the world is owned by two people who have the names Jenni Brewer and Ronald Reagan although I must say that Jenni definitely has the better half because she has a mystical view of life that no one else even comes close to having, yet she stil enjoys it whereas I don’t really know if the President who was President when I had my first memories really has this thorough joy that pervades everyone around Jenni, even when she is mad or sad sighing the blues that seem so separate from her true psyche and, yes, even when she parl-ed that there francais that we Lumbertonians are so well known for even though we are better known as the town near where Michael Jordan’s father was murdered (yet, neither I nor Jenni was involved in that particular incidnet, and the same holds true for all but two residents of Robeson County, of which Lumberton is the county seat) but, hopefully, Jenni will make Lumberton better known for winning the All-American thing this year after all, she is helping to represent Lumberton at Cleveland (which she thinks is a funny name it sounds like a place where a bunch of cooks tenderize meat) but if we do not win out rightful position as home of the best people in America, you, I, and everyone that knows Jenni will realize that she is the best person on the planet (with a close following by Ronald Reagan, and then by Alex Trebek, who knows how to properly pronounce “slaw” unlike some people in Lumberton who actually pronounce the “w” whereas I tend to only pronounce the “a,” as does Alex) and, yet, I say this with some apprehension because Alex is Canadian even though I love all Canadians and truly enjoy their dual nature as French and British (my two favorite places, with the United States somewhere in between) but some Southerners look upon Canada with distrust, perhaps because of its reputation as a holding place for slaves that escaped the tyranny of the somewhat ignorant rulers of the South (not to offend any Southerners or racists, wink, wink) but I think that it is a good thing when a United States citizen can truly proclaim their love for another country with a much smaller population and with a reputation of harboring people escaping for the Vietnam War draft, which is exactly something I think that Jenni would do because she is such a cool person, but I am going to have to add one person that owns the world after Alex, and that would be Dr. Parker, my high school principal whose stern look and strict rules made the school a much better place in which to exist free from the fights and drugs common to so much of society so I, Joseph Michael Rozier have stated my philosophy on life and the Art of Motorcylce Maintenance (wait, I guess I didn’t actually do that, but it would have made one fantabulous addition to this miniscule phrase on the seemingly infinite sentence) and, though I have never read Zen and that Art, I have seen it (with a quick reference to Chris Kelley, who mistakenly believes that empty space is not Chemistry when it actually is because the lack of something is just as signficant as the presence of something in my view) so, I, Joseph Michael Rozier, alternatively known at different times in my life as Jo-Jo, Joey, Rainman, Junebug, a Nuclear Powered Friend, a nerd, and a great storyteller (although I don’t know if August Hammonds was actually serious when she said that, I actually think that it was a criticism now that I am thinking about thinking about it) and, no, I did not include any neat or original things to this sentence such as symbols, pictures, or sounds, but I did pour my heart (that is, the heart of Joseph Michael Rozier) into making a tribute to one of my bestest friends in the whole wide world, Jenni Brewer which I hope that she enjoys so this is the end of my phrase, which I hope was grammatically correct, although I am afraid that I may have ended a part with a preposition, which I know is illegal so that is the end of my speech and I shall now say bye, although I am not ending the sentence so, I Joseph Michael Rozier, am sorry, but I must make the following addition to the above stated phrase about my hero, Jennie Brewer: just to make sure no extreme right-wing people hate her and no extreme left-wing people get their hopes up, the part where I was talking about liking Canada and that it had a reputation of draft dodgers, I said that I thought that Jenni would do that, I was referring to liking Canada, and not dodging the draft because I know that Jenni is a great, All-American person who would blindly do what the government told her to do, no matter what the consequences (yeah, right) so she would never dodge the draft, but I have a feeling she would love Canada, which was the correction I was trying to make so that no one would understand my friend Jenni and that, my friends, is the rest of the story (in a way) Hey, I’m not pushing you awar from me, I’m pulling me closer to myself So Help Me GOD!

adrress, which of course was no use to me, because I needed her phone number or so I thought, which, as it turned out, I was wrong to think, because then I thought maybe I could get on the net and find her number in a round about sort of way, at which point I decided to get to it and I typed ‘boarding school’ (because thats where her adress is, a girls boarding school in PA, where she is a teacher or faculty member of some sort) and what came up was not anything useful but instead it was this, this maddening setence, and of course I decided I had to be a part of it, and looked for someplace where I could submit something, only to discover that the only place I could write something was is a little box which was not quite at the end of the sentence, which I found odd, surely, but no odder than this thing itself, and so I proceeded to type, nothing of relevance really just how, basically, I happened to come upon this thing and, although I started in the middle of my tale-as all great epics do, mind you-I figured it would be much more in the spirit of this mess and therefore decided to go on with it--not very creative, I guess, and, to tell you the truth, I have my concerns over my fascination with this effort, for, having just read Neitzsche and finding myself in agreement with him over a statement he made, well, instead of paraphrasing I will quote him, and so here it is, without further ado ‘best sellers are always ill-smellers, sticky with the odor of small people’ and he goes on to say ‘where people eat and sleep, and even where they worship,it usually stinks’ now I’m not saying that this is a best-seller, or, for that matter, a place of worship (although in that respect there could be a good deal of healthy debate) but instead I feel that what attracts people to this and to a contribution in this large communal repodepository is a need to assimilate a part of themselves into an expression and creation of the larger society which I don’t necessarily think is a thing for small people only and instead is just part of being human, superhuman included, for, at some level, I guess, stink is a relative thing anyway, and besides, my balls stink, but that doesn’t mean i’m going to chop them of, or perhaps it wouldn’t be such a bad idea thereupon I thought to myself, “hey, why don’t I try to look her up on the ph server or whatever it

them written, I wonder where is my sister Mary and does she know her brother is watching. it’s not easy being me test the Galaxy, it’s also a mirror of the Internet population as of today: most of the sentence is in English but you can find bits in German, Polish, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and other languages I could not even recognize, so it’s global all right but not only, the content of the Sentence itself gives a very good sociological view of Net users: as Technical Conceptor Gary Welz puts it “In some sense we can regard the Sentence as a snapshot of the Internet community at the present time - widely dispersed, fascinated with the new technology, rabidly vocal, recklessly adolescent and shamelessly uncontrolled” many contributors are writing about themselves, putting links to their own pages, plenty are playing with the technical possibilities of HTML writing to put bold, big characters into the Sentence to break its monotony, some are writing off their phantasms as they would on a graffiti wall, many are taking this Sentence as a game and take up the challenge of writing on and on what goes through their mind just to be part of history; because this sentence is now part of history, ever since its conceptor, writer and first generation video artist (back in the late 60’s) Douglas Davis started it on the net in early December 94 “Actually it was meant to stay there until February 15, 95 but the Sentence was already doing three miles long at that time and I just felt it did not belong to me anymore, when I started, I wanted to shock the world with its own brilliance and involvement with serious issues of communication, expression, art, literature, and even grammar” insists Davis, “not so much on the megalomaniac side of net users”; so it goes on and on, in June alone, the Host computer of the Sentence recorded more than 50,000 hits, it’s impossible to know how many people made a contribution to the Sentence, but Douglas Davis guesses that it goes into “thousands of people”, and it will grow even more, especially in Asia, since the Sentence is one of the attraction of the Kwangju Biennale in Korea which is held in mid-september, one of the contributor, Eugene Schwartz, who is a famous collector of Contemporary art, a long time admirer of Douglas’s work and has purchased many works Douglas did, even bought a disc with the sentence, the pictures, the sound and the video thst are included in the sentence for an undisclosed amount of money but anyway money is not the problem here, what counts is that this World First and Longest Collaborative Sentence clearly means on the net the birth of a new “period” and I do hope that the Sentence Isn’t done and even if it is no one will read my silly little SUBmission because i’m way far down here - far from the bits I left up Town- and I just want to share something that I discovered today and that is that’s its impossiblr to live in the NOW, even if we had a cosmic radio announcer who said AT THE TONE IT IS NOW BEEEEEEP there would be now in the beginning of the beeeep and a now in the middle and at the end and by the time the beeep was in your ears it wouldn’t even be NOW anymore it would be THEN and just thinking about how we’re all actually livivng in the THEN is a bit strange but not AS strange as the fact that this is probably a veritable COMPENDIUM of CORNINESS with all the corny things a lot of people but most certainly not ALL wanted to say and make it sound deep or cool or neo-way-out-beatnik, even though the last beatnik wasted away I think which is sad because I always wanted to meet one and I wonder if I put my address on this wou;d anyone even notice not as though I’m going to after all I’m not some chic chick out for a kinky stalker to add flavor (vanilla or otherwise) to my life and now I think its time for me to GO TO BED so GOOD NIGHT AMERICA SLEEP WELL AND SWEET VERY OH SO SWEET DREAMS and i wish i were in love with someone don’t you it’s not easy being me Ahhh the fishes have tales to tell and stuff to show we must be part of this its in our gills they tell us so green and a half worms of August and well, it’s past the date all of you said but you never said we couldn’t ANYWAY so here’s a fragment for you, just a little piece of my illusions for your very own, new and improved, half the fat, calories, and assorted little furry creatures that live in dark places and don’t come out much, except to use the bathrooms, which of course they haven’t -got- anyway in the little dark places where the furry things live, but my little fragment that i’m giving you has -half- of them now, for your very own, ever and always, and you can even show it to your grandchildren and say I Was There When, you see, but you can’t have ANY MORE OF ME, damn you all, so don’t ask je suis fatigue maintenant s’il te plait au revoir bonjour merci ohayo toide doko goodbye world umm five, no this is a yuesday isnt it, truck, they stole the cat again, how much time is spent in the pursuit of fleeting gratification and how many more ways do we need to pursue it you know, my mother named me Briar and although many people think this was perhaps after something cute like Sleeping Beauty (aka Briar Rose), really it was just after the heroine in some smut novel she picked up in the grocery store some time in the early 70’s - and isn’t that just the way of the world? never in my whole life not ever have i done anything like this no not me not once except yesterday but even then it wasn’t like this so it shouldn’t count so don’t count it do don’t don’t donut donate done Hi, my name is Brian from Philly my life is a complete and utter mess my brilliant snubbing of the one woman in my life was ended prematurely when I attempted to call her today (to say that I no longer wanted to speak with or see her even again since she is driving me nuts) but is that what I really want, I must ask myself wondering if perhaps some divine force turned off her phone so I can cool off and relax a bit and decide what to do what to do what to do right now I am emotionless, completely emotionless, not to mention making my virgin contribution to this sentence I can’t possibly solve the mystery of my life, but can YOU just testing this form in the middle of the third part of the sentence whilst searching for my virgin contribution made earlier * by the way, could somebody (if they chance to read this) please post how to make text bigger, put up links, and put up pictures? she said “well, there we were, my man and i walking along on our way over to Pierre’s you know that bar over there by the cinema near the Zone and we were on our way over there even though the acts there are really nothing compared to what they used to be when Miss Virginia Ham was lip synching there, i mean, the kids today just don’t have it; when i was first coming into drag, i made my own outfits and it was all a craft, an art; today these young kids just buy their own; and i just *don’t* want to know where they get the money; probably into drugs; i never made that kind of money when i was hooking; but the whole management thing got on my nerves so i just left that bad boy in the dust and went freelance and started flagging down truckers, standing on the corner and waving at them; and i know i’m not looking mighty real now, since the cops tore my outfit like this (those brutes) but i was looking so very real that most of those phobic good old boys never knew that i give good head because a girl like me knows what a man like him wants; but anyways, i was explaining how i got here; so there we were walking over to Pierre’s Bar and my man is wearing his stonewall 25 gay pride t-shirt that we got at the dance on the USS Independence and suddenly these two cute adorable college boys in their frat shirts start hollering at us, calling my man a fag-boy; well, we ignored them, after all, a lady has her dignity; but they started following us and calling out the most dreadful things to us; and just as we were getting close to the busy part of the street, they ran up behind us and knocked him down and asked why i was hanging out with a fag-boy like that; and, well, i may not look it now, but i was a wrestler in high school and i used to box until i realized that i just couldn’t cut it as a butch boy; so i decked the one closest to me and when the other one pulled a knife, i just took it away from him and slapped him upside the head so very hard that it knocked him out cold; the first one had gotten up by this time and was running back over to me with hatred in his eyes, but i knocked him out too; after all, a girl has to protect her man, doesn’t she, now; but that’s what the cops couldn’t understand about it because when they showed up they were nice and friendly until they realized that i wasn’t a real girl, and it’s just a little piece of flesh but it upset them mightily; and so they took me in and worked me over and that’s why i’m here, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe all mimsy were the borogroves and the mome raths outgrabe It is at this point that all has been settled the inner and outer beauty of the body and the soul as I wait for him reflections of that first moment of that first sentence stays with me forever and now I wait hoping that soon he will pass thru me space again and I will be whole Hey I’m sitting here in the Cybercafe in SoHo with Raphael and he says, “Now I know what happened to the Tower of Babel” I hate stupid shit, and I hate stupid people, stupid people who think they sound educated or witty or funny or perverted or strange, and they think they are revealing some all encompassing knowledge or worldly truth when all they really know about is their own tiny micro world, and they get some cheep thrill out of this pseudo-vouyerism and an even more perverted high from the knowledge that other vouyers are reading their stupid shit, all these people think they are a part of some huge global community when all they really are is a group of lost individuals who think they know who they are, they can’t see that this world is but a prison, filled with simple toys to keep our minds off of the shit beneath, they struggle to forget, to erase the true world from their memory, and many do, living a lie in a world they created for themselves from their own imagination, and now they are stuck in that fucking limbo of false happiness frolicking in their own shit, But I am not as synical as I seem, because I search for a light, some hope that things can be different, and I have tried, tried fucking hard in fact to change my world or to have it change me, but nothing works, and I go on, and maybe one day I will triumph but probably not because we are all fooled by those simple toys and I eventually will stop to play, and when that happens I will have lost my way, all my progress erased, and my one true hope gone forever, Please dont leave me hope, I may be imperfect in every way but I am still trying to get through, to reach my apex of reality, and I will not let you fucking beat me, I will not stop and play, I will win, I will find life, I will find love, I will find peace in my world and then I will tell all those lost souls what you have held from them, just wait and see, and to the vouyers, I know this was a rather sloppy, gramatically incorrect passage lacking some continuity of thought but please don’t hold that against my message, it was as true to me as I could possibly make it, and finally to hope, look for me in the near future, I’ll be knockin’, you better answer Is there a point at writing a sentence without one was the question I asked myself when I looked at “The World First (and Longest) Collaborative Sentence” a few days ago: this sentence goes on and on, upon more than 300 K, and without a single period in it (actually there is because hackers found a way to force periods into the program), but it is not only the longest sentence on this side of the Galaxy, it’s also a mirror of the Internet population as of today: most of the sentence is in English but you can find bits in German, Polish, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and other languages I could not even recognize, so it’s global all right but not only, the content of the Sentence itself gives a very good sociological

phsycho that haunts the dreams that you dream, your dream that is going nowhere just like this plane in my mind, it keeps circling, looking for a landing strip but there isn’t one in sight because this isn’t where we all should be, on a plain, dreaming the night away in out nice soft beds with dreams dance in our heads, the dreams linger as the sun comes up, the moon is gone and so are the wishes and dreams that once inhabited the vast plain in our minds, now it’s time to work, work as hard as we can so we can hurry up and die, an eternal, never ending dream, a tale that will never be told until the listeners already know the secret that has been kept for so long, as long ago as the first human has this secret been kept, it will be kept for ages to come, and infinite time this secret will be kept, told only to the keepers themselves, does the dream last forever I ask myself, does it only last a split second before we are forced to dream no more I ask myself, what if there are no more dreams, what if all that is left is an eternal nothing that lasts forever, never giving up, never releasing it’s grasp until time ends, then what happens I ask myself, if there is no time to have dreams, and no dreamers to dream, then what happens to everything that the was worked so hard for I ask myself, it will simply be gone and all the efforts that were put into creating such a wonderful (or not) thing will be gone, will we have another chance to do it all over again, will we be able to regain what we have so suddenly lost, or will the never be another dream, now I dream, maybe for the last time, maybe for the first, I dream away in my nice soft bed while I drift off to another world come back home i didn’t expect to reach the end of the sentence,presuming that it would be about x amount of pages after that which i stopped viewing and went on to something else BUT,since that is (by the time you read this WAS) not the case, I shall add something (however humble/vain) to the world’s longest,”run-on ing est”,fortunatly (for me) english-biased sentence in history,in which i too,shall try to merge with the collective by (esentially) talking to myself and in that manner divulge something however slight or encoded about myself and at the same time and by the same means tell something to you,in a sort of self-referential, run-on ,”its-not-in-what-i-say-but-how-i-say-it manner,so that by the time that you the reader (all of you) reach this part you will A) been expesed to yet one more personality in the inumerable amount of

My name is Andy Murphy, and perhaps someday this will mean something, but maybe it never will to anyone but me, when I was in elementary, I used to actually try not to create a run-on sentence, but now I’m doing it on purpose, (and THERE ARE PEROIDS HERE, SOMEONE NEEDS TO DELETE THEM) but I had no clue what I was talking about because I was a computer geek All night I channel surf through New York’s cable TV stations, A spacecraft flies over America, I am sitting without motion staring at a screen of constantly changing colors and sounds, Sometimes I write a number on a piece of paper and send it to the place where the colors and sounds are born, In the morning I wake up with a new concept: All night I channel surf through New York’s cable TV stations, A spacecraft flies over America, I am sitting without motion, staring at a screen of constantly changing colors and sounds, Sometimes I write a number on a piece of paper and send it to the place where the colors and sounds are born, In the morning I wake up with a new concept: Submit if it is that way at all, wqhen the little thoughts flit along the surface on a bright, clear hot day, the kind of day that is much more pleasant in memory than fact, WOW this sentence is amazingly long, if anyone actually reads the whole sentence, then they need to go for some serious psychotherapy, and does anyone know the address for MENSA cuz I would like to get a test from them, and also am I REALLY FAMOUS now that I am a part of the worlds longest sentence, actually, this is more than one sentence because some people put “periods” in whatever they wrote :-) Well, this is my second contribution to this sentence, it’s too bad that people have to perverse something that is meant for HARMONY I Love Robby but sadly he doesn’t love me I will go for coffe it will make everything seem not so bad i hope the human race in the next century isn’t as mentally deranged as me ebb-site vision of reconnect earlier unplugged void t’ print the nights through the medium of form AMANDA COX IS THE PATRIOT MISSILE OF HUMOR!

evening Hi I’m Debbie Just one question what kind of people are writing in this long sentence I’ve read some preety wierd stuff Its probaly good I didnt read everything I know i’d be shocked some of these people are to young to talk about sex and orgasims need to concentrate on your school work and not who your going to lay tonight if you even wait till tonight I know sex is a wonderful thing but so is an education now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country just sitting hee reading this long sentence and decided to respnd putting my two cents in to it for what purpose I don’t know actually I have nothing better to do at the moment so I decided to play on the internet and found this sentence with no periods my kind of writing and you don’t have to worry about spelling either the weathers getting warm and it’s time for a vacation take a break from school learning to much at one time can fry your brain it’t not good for you your brain works slower than teachers teach sometimes you can’t grasp it all don’t get me wrong I enjoy sex to I have a set of twins to prove that but there’s a time and place for everything and everything has a time and place no periods, no periods I have to keep reminding myself or it’s possible I could forget and put one and mess up this sentence but I’ll try not to I’m from Caroline County whats happening around your way respond if you choose would like to hear from you little lambs and oatsie doatsies just part of a song my Uncle used to sing to me when I was a child no more snow, no more snow no more snow I think

you good people some time in the near future having to work is a real pain in the ass wouldn’t it be simplier if the government paid us to go to school instead of making us work for our education we already do that when we recieve our grades what else do they want Un texto añadido con eñes BASSCAVE STUDIO THE EPICENTER OF SUBTERREAN SURROUND SOUND! and then I found out that my charming girlfriend had actually cheated on me 6 days BEFORE I left NYC with A BOY and I was crushed and crazy and almost crashed my father’s spanking new convertible and then I just hung out for a couple months, preparing for my junior year abroad in Florence (Firenze) Italy (Italia) and all was insane but OK until my mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer in August and I flew to Phoenix where she lives and where I was born and where I hate to be and stayed with her wondering if I would still andare a Firenze and in the end I did, knowing that she would be in radiation and things were great although I worried and I lived in Italy and I spoke Italian and was happy and then I even started talking to my darling ex again because she was in England, in Oxford, and I went to see her for three weeks at Christmas and little did I know I was walking into a house of insanity and ghosts and my ex-girlfriend sleeping with her tall, albino, gay male housemate and I have never felt so fucked over and then I left without speaking to her anymore, intending to not ever speak to her anymore, and then I got back to my darling appartamento a Firenze and found out my mother’s cancer had spread to her abdomen, and then I found out that it had spread to her liver and then I called her doctor who finally came out and told me he gave her 6-18 months to live and then I went home, stopping in NY on my way to see my friends and intending to stop in SF to see my city but no sooner had I landed in NY than my friend’s answering machine carried a message telling me to call the hospital in Phoenix because Mom was in it and then I found out that the cancer was everywhere and they were giving her 2 months to live and I flew to Phoenix the next day and that was a month ago and ever since then I have been the caretaker to my mother/my idol and I love her so much and I am being so strong and I do not cry now but simply help her with her IV of morphine and wonder what it means when you find yourself changing your idol’s colostomy bag but really all I want to tell you all is to appreciate every second of your life because you never know when your girlfriend may sleep with some boy (gay or otherwise) or you may have to leave your perfect appartamento a Firenze per sempre (forever) or when your idol may die--- we three became one - one thrust, one scream, one lightning bolt to the groin from both back and front and then she left the next morning and we were two once more How nice is to be a human between people, oops maybe not yet today i cannot say that i understand where it is coming from or where it

June 27,1996 I put the date in because when I read the sentence I couldn’t tell when I was getting to the end (Is there an end) (I wonder how many other people wrote theirs late at night probably most of them because so many seem to be just pouring out stream of consiousness but I guess that is what this sentence is , the stream of the plantary mind Have you ever realized that the internet and web are just like comeing to a portal or transporter that can take you anywhere on the planet the moment you want to go it is like haveing a closet you can walk into and it takes you to the most wonderful places isn’t interesting that they didn’t put any returns in the text box so it feels like you can babble on forever am I a reincarnation of Jame Joyce or just very very very tired my husband is asleep my boys Ian and Aaron are asleep and here I am still at the damm computer is this really immortality whe do somany people want to write in this sentence, why do I it would be really interesting to loop these lines back and forth like ribbon candy oh I see I have finally hit the return too bad I kind of liked not seeing where I had been but now here is all that history riding along with me very sad I don’t think I will last long enough to get to another return Laurel DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND, THE COLLECTIVE IQ OF THE GENERAL POPULATION IS LOWER THAN HALF THE POPULATIONS SINGULAR IQ ONE OUT OF EVERY THREE OR LESS PEOPLE ARE TO YOU A COMPLETE MORON NO WONDER WHEN YOU DRIVE YOU TEND TO WONDER ABOUT THE INTENTIONS OR MOTIVATIONS OF OTHERS AND THE FACT THAT WHAT THEY JUST DID MAKES NO SENSE WHAT-SO-EVER WHEN YOU DRIVE ON A PARKWAY OR PARK ON A DRIVEWAY DOES YOUR DICK GET STUCK IN THE DOOR Desperately Seeking Infinity- Trey Harper I am in the world i have a voice the internet allows me to heard or at least offers the illusion sframe@mica.edu This is my life story I met this girl on the net Where haven’t you heard this story before I met her two years ago Yet, even, it is not so sad as you might guess She is in my own city Things started nicely It was her first year of university, and she was bristling with thoughts Thoughts much like my own But even beyond them She was mystery, she was beauty, she was wise She touched me in a place I didn’t know I had She understood me But, my feelings came out in small, obtrusive ways The long goodbyes, the hanging sentences, the delicate subtle conversations To her, this was too much from a person she hadn’t met Finally I realized what was happening and apologized, tried to start over, but it was too late :( Xmas came by, I asked to start again I had missed her for 3 months, but at least the initial infatuation had passed This time, I was very bashful and waited to test my ground And waited For the whole rest of the year, I don’t know if I got to know her any better There was some chance of meeting that summer, but it never happened I missed her all summer Then another year went by She was still on my mind I felt compelled to write her from time to time, but no answer Finally, after making her feel special on valentine’s day, she talked to me again Then, one of her friends asked to meet me And then, the big day, which I have been waiting for for two years We met She seemed happy to see me I felt strangely peaceful But we didn’t really have a chance to talk Now, I am not getting along with her friend, and may never see her again I still like her I don’t know why I’d like to figure this out I don’t expect her to like me, no I haven’t for a long time now I would just like to know her a bit, maybe it would help me get over it But, all this time she has refused to talk about what is going on It has been frustrating, and whatever I do, I can’t forget it Even now I have a real girlfriend, but I miss her more than my real girlfriend! I had once chance to work things out She was only a few feet away for hours But it would have been awkward, and I thought I might see her again I certainly didn’t want to make her uncomfortable I wanted her to know that even though I have liked her for so long, I am still a normal person, I have fun with my friends, I am nice and polite, and I am not obsessed with every girl I meet But if I could go back now, at least I could hug her, I think that would make me feel much better I haven’t even asked her friend a lot of questions about her I wouldn’t do anything that seems bad I feel like I owe it to myself to do something more, yet I can’t It REALLY TEARS ME up to think of her leaving here, even if I’m not talking to her now It’s so final I know she listens to me when I write, even if she doesn’t reply It seems like I need her in someway I don’t want to I’ve missed her almost everyday It’s a part of life The way I look at it, I’m lucky to feel this kind of passion If she ever liked me, what a great feeling it could be This is the ultimate goal of a passionate love Anyhow, for all I know she has a boyfriend, and I’m not free, so I don’t expect that I wish I knew how she was I need to see her again before it’s too late I don’t know what will happen, but I hope to get some answers, to know how she feels, to make sense of this all, so I can let my heart rest in peace Is that too much to ask? WE ARE CHILDREN OF CREATIVITY, THIS VERY WORLD REVOLVES AROUND THE INCREDIBLE CREATIVITY OF THE HUMAN MIND, AND IF YOU WISH TO TO SHUT THIS OUT OF YOUR NARROW MIND, THEN IT IS LITTLE WONDER THAT THIS SENTENCE GOES WAY OVER YOUR HEAD what does all this mean to anyone if what does all this mean to anyone if so I continued to include all of us, but it was so discouraging: no one understanding or saying much more than the usual non-committed jargon that only us crazies could really (that’s REALLY care about), not that any of it is, shall we say exclusively the art of the manic chowderhead or any other derogatory name that is bandied about at us by “you know who”) and yet we still (or better yet, rephrased, I STILL) carry on; never ever forgetting the purpose (oh please Lord) never ever forgetting that all shall pass You people have way to much time on your hadns, but then again I must have way too much time on my hands to sit here and add on to this sentence are you a Ron & Ron fan? life is eternal the difficulty in life is the choice *If you choose not to decide You have still made a choice*Je bent de enige die ik bekijk* Je bent mijn euwige licht* Mijn immer (of altijd) glanixende ster* Stars can be heaven bound, but the most special STARS are heart bound live long and prosper with beans and peas that reach the heavens and I’d also like to thank Mr and Mrs Collige who have looked after me for all these years and who, when I was younger used to take me out to feed the CROCODILES which was a very harrowing experience and we also used to kneel together and pray “God bless America”, AMERICA NEEDS IT Brocoli can cure cancer and so can califlower and other disgusting vegatables, but only if you stick them in the exact spot where the cancer is growing, and then you have to but on a grass skirt and do a dance, but if you do the dance wrong, it won’t work and then you will die of the cancer anyways, so you might as well go ahead and die now, because i know you and you mess up all the time becuase you suck but I couldn’t have done it intirely without I wanted to link a theory page because contrary to popular opinion I live for theory just not the one “true” meta theory ;) which may well benefit from surrendering some of its Ideals in the process of considering some of its effects in the real world and by now one could know what “real” has meant in this drawn out discourse if one has been listening but I couldn’t find one so I’ll have to wing it and say it in my own words which would be quite a shift after merely grafting onto the page that of others for so long and simply recall I once read oops so much for that own words effort that stand up comics make objects of humor out of those things they think are truly sad as in a sorry state of affairs in order to transform them into something a little less sad I’m not sure that theory works in practice which doesn’t make it not descriptive of the intent of the stand up comic’s routine but I don’t remember standing up so I think maybe someone else did it for me when I wasn’t there and I do know that as a result well you know the resultss nevertheless I still insist on the “I” vs the pronouncements from the inner circles on how  i was never meant to be upper case but someone capitalized on it until it was but mine never really was and this is not really new only You don’t see it because You weren’t there either such are the times that make you sweat and look sadly toward the end of the millenium the only rebellion worth having is the one inside you,the one that shatters your inhibitions and your fears and makes you question your beliefs, real revolution starts first in the souls of the revolutionaries,and spreads outward,like the warmth of a sun,all revolutions must come 360,the warmth of freedom will reach us all only when we go mad and are willing to give up your freedom,because only the mad are truly free, and our jealousy drives us to lock them up, and try to “cure” them, to make the twisted pathways of a broken mind turn back “straight” to the grey monotony of cruel “reality”, from the colorfulness of insanity,and that’s all I wrote, so, hmmm so did anyone tell you that the revolution will not be televised? I WALKED HOME IN THE RAIN TE OTHER DAY AND FELT HAPPY THE OTHER NIGHT HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD SLEEP WITH HIM BY GRADUATION AND I SAID YES BUT WAS HE JKING AND EVEN IF HE WAS ODES IT MEAN ANYTHING ANYWAY OR I AM JUST WISHING IT DID SO I CAN HOLD ON TO THIS DREAM BUT I WANT TO DO SO MCUCH AND ONE DAY HE’LL BE GONE I GUESS IT’S NOT MEANT TO BE BUT I KNOW HE’S NOT THE MAN I’M GOING TO MARRY BUT I DO LOVE HIM AND I DON’T SEE WHY HE CAN’T LOVE ME BACK BUT MAYBE HE DOES AND NEITHER OF US WANT TO ADMIT TO IT SO THAT’S WHY IT GOES UNSAID BUT HE’S STILL MY BEST FREND AND THAT WILL ALWAYS BE I JUST WISH HE COULD LOVE ME i think in the course of life maybe sometimes one should obtain professional advice and seek wow, there is only one way to heaven and that is by repenting of the sin in your life, which is unrighteousness, the stuff that god hates, and accepting jesus into your life and then serving him and not this screwed up world of instant gratification, chow Life is so sweet, don’t waste a minute, live it with verve and ever grateful thanks to the Lord God and a preacher no less what is the sermon for today lord? GOD is GOOD all the time all the time GOD is GOOD and every mystery of life every question that you have is in the BIBLE How is GOD good all the time, you ask, how is HE good when there is hate in the world how does HE allow suffering if HE’S such a good GOD here’s your answer GOD is GOD HE can do whatever HE wants HE CAN STRIKE US ALL DOWN AND KILL US ALL IF WANTS TO BUT EVERYTHING HE DOES WHETHER IT CAUSES GRIEF IN OUR LIVES OR JOY IS FOR THE GOOD OF ALL IF WE DON’T SUFFER HOW WOULD WE KNOW JOY IF THERE IS NO EVIL HOW WOULD WE KNOW GOOD IF THERE IS NO DARKNESS HOW WOULD WE KNOW LIGHT THE TRUTH IS WE AS HUMANS CAN NOT AND SHOULD NOT DARE TO ASK GOD WHY BECAUSE HE IS GOD GOD HAS CHANGED MY LIFE AND CAN CHANGE YOUR TO ALL OF YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW GOD BEFORE YOU DENY HIM AND JESUS CHRIST FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM READ THE BIBLE BE OPEN-MINDED YOU OPEN YOUR MIND TO EVERYTHING ELSE WHAT WOULD IT HURT YOU IF YOU READ THE BIBLE AND ASKED QUESTIONS AND FOUND OUT THE TRUTH I HATE BEING LOGICAL WHEN IT COMES TO GOD ‘CAUSE HE’S SO MUCH GREATER THAN LOGIC HE IS BEYOND WHAT ANY OF US CAN COMPREHEND HE’S GOOD AND HE’S WILLING TO LOVE YOU IF YOU OPEN UP YOUR HEART TO HIM YOU NEED JESUS HE DIED FOR YOU SO THAT YOU CAN LIVE IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT MORE FIND OUT MORE I HOPE YOU FIND HIM AND FIND WHAT MAKES YOU REALLY HAPPY I HOPE YOU FIND TRUE LOVE AGAPE LOVE upon which I immediately ran screaming from the room in a last-ditch attempt to prevent myself from taking a blunt object and forcibly making contact with my classmates and my know-nothing teacher, Mr Yanku and so why did you do that? Well I would just like to ask a question - who said teenagers are supposed to be ‘angry’ because i wish they were wrong Alright I’ll admit it i am angry, I am angry that my room mate tries to committ suicide and that henry will not fall in love with me I am angry that christy got al without lusting after him like i did i am angry that i can not quit smoking and that i can’t live up to my brother when i was little graham pulled me to the garbage dumpster in front of our house and told me to sit there and wait for the garbage man to come and pick me up I waited and i am still waiting it pisses me off that i can’t take control of me life that i have never known LOVE well i’ve know love but if it is what i thought it was it’s a pile of shit I was at a party in Vancouver this past summer and this guy named Andy with red hair and a hearing aid seduced me but id on’t know how cause he was butt ugly but he kissed me a called me sexy and made me feel worthwhile and i don’y know but i sucked on his cock and i guess i wanted to but i’m angry that i couldn’t control myself you may think that all the drugs and alcohol i had that night (schmirnoff, ole elnglish, shrooms, speed, pot, canadian, more shrooms and more pot0 was hwat impaired me but it wasn’t I IMPAIR MYSELF and I take drugs to make me happy and i smoke because I am in love with nicotine and i fall in love because i want to be loved and i kiss guys because they will kiss me and i would probably fuck any guy if e gave two shits about me and i don’t care what people think and i say that line with so much confidence it’s all one big lie you know than this summer jamie and i wound up in my little brothers bed (he wears hearing aids too) and i was ashamed and i still am but i was drunk and was on a shitload of drugs and I WAS HAPPY AT THE TIME and i sit here wondering what all of this should have taught me but realize i haven’t learned but know that there is a lesson THE LESSON IS TO NOT FUCK EVRYONE AND ANYONE but i am not a slut - far from it - I could almost qualify as a nun i have fallen in love and I can never feel that love reciprocated i love you all - anyone who knows who i am - I love you and i am asking for your help to make me happy And then he stuck his long thick cock up my rear end i screamed in delight as he rubbed a ping pong paddle over my back he says he likes the way it makes me scream he undoes the handcuffs and turns me around he starts to suck my breasts he sucks them for so long and so hard they hurt and then he laughs and brings his brother billy into the room he tells me to sit roll over and to fetch like a dog they all laugh at me then billy opens his fly and tells me to come and sit on his lap i oblige and billy has the time of his life This be one damn long sentence I really don’t know what to say but that’s how it’s always been with me, and I don’t think that now is anytime for it to change, but now is a good time for anything and no one seems to care that I am alone typing, alone loveless, and I know that there is someon else out there, or here, even that is alone, and maybe is that person is a cool, and that person is a girl, that, that person and I may perhaps be able to make happy toghether, but I’m not a smart man, and the world is a big place, almost too big to think about all at once, but I’d like some pie now, like mama used to make, before my lunch decides to crawl out and make a mess on my keyboard, and then I’d likely as not have to procure a new keyboard and learn to skip lunch what a drag as to have to live like this and this may or maynot be proper at all for a person of your standing, but we are all students, and not enough teachers, only they are everywhere and more, so look inside yourself, and save us in time of judgement or else make me a sandwich that will stay down this time and how about some ail, good for what ales you, or some other product of my diseased mind and someimes my HTML decides to walk up and get itself a coffee but doesn’t bring any back for me while I slave away at my job without thanks and listen to my noise and sometimes things just flip out and sometimes things just fall into place, but wouldn’t you say this is like some big game of telephone, with all the wires mixed up and not stopping for the ladybugs so they climb over and no i am not psychotic, i just play one on TV but I’d be happier if i were, but i am, so I can’t be in the past anymore than I am in the future and lets just leave it up to the scientists, but I think that sometimes thinks look pretty and cauliflower, may have been done by adatan, the worldbender and gleaner of gleans, thrower of flour and tosser of socks in a ball of sourse, like it should be, but then again, goodbye, and hello to everyone who is not here yet, and waiting to be born and borne into this place that may swallow us yet but hasn’t so be good and santa will bring you your favorites next year, as if that were an incentive, oh, but it is, and i still think tha I am not psychotic, but then again ears are in short supply before class H Bloom said “Men write romantic writing, women write romantisistick writing, Romantisisick by Rosalind” and Dr Theory said who said that and Bloom repeated it and Dr Tx said “Yeah, I had a feeling it had to be someone not too smart” and Dr Tx was always throwing scraps like that and its not that one couldn’t hear them falling but it got too painful to run around and pick them up to put together a cauliflower dinner because telephone never was a yummy game for anyone except for Bloom who was so deaf he thought he was actually going to have his day in the sun without wilting from it, but oh!-- i’m sorry this has nothing to do with this Sentence and you weren’t there and you’re not here either and if you were here I couldn’t hear you anyway but of course I will make you your lunch, I will always fix your lunch, only if you don’t like it then you should learn how to cook for yourself Whatever it’s certainly not he one that wears tracksuits, she’s eminently forgettable, still, each to their own i suppose you know its quite hard to write without allowing my playful fingers to gently caress the full stop or period as the americanos call it, si, si, si, see senor and HOW MANY HAIKUS CAN YOU FIND IN THIS SENTENCE, i would like to know it is not the place a person is from but the person that you see join and then comes a look or a touch and a thing in me says “YES” for a moment I am part of the celestial melody always teasing the soul right at the edge of awareness when and it’s like everytime we put our ears against the seashell we hear another storm it swooshes around our heads like the lava lamps in our nightly club life clubs homosexual lava men dancing around tiny boys all wrapped up in old newspapers, the ECHO of the seashell rings again taking us to another place a place where lesbian midgets make cocktails in bikini tops we are seduced by their coolness the shy transparent night makes us think about other times, other places; jock straps that were too smelly; my junior hockey team wanting to gang bang you, oh you were so strong; you never gave in to their juvenille threats and alcohiolic stained breath and fists, you grew up to be a molessted free child with mustard on your brow and the tiny midget behind the counter told me that I should try irc, that maybe throught the magic o cybersex we could reach or climax, that way we would never have to touch or look at eachother, and we would have the added bonus of staining our keyboard with well let’s not be vulgar and the seashell rings agaian swoosh swoosh listen do you hear the ocean i don’t you can’t hear anything on here unless it’s real audio and fully paid for Eat zebra cakes wow - i feel empowered nnnnnnnnnnnn The equations of science know of no here or now, but they tell us that time and space can be interchanged to an extent, here and now are simply where you are, now is defined by the existance of your mind right NOW, the same way you define here, you are here and you are now hear but write now i am righting a paper and the lifeline is approaching would you rather read the wellwroughturn or would you rather read someone whose reach exceeds their grasp, where the pieces fall into place incorrectly from somewhere, from the place thats notenglishmajor why anything other than love except of course matters to do with love and if love, then everything, astonishing, and everything is alive, alive, in love, Nads nads That’s my alias I got skillz you see so don’t fuck with me I’ll drop mad knowledge at home or at college don’t need a reason to type this season so let the words flow and let go or if you got girl get a blow I smoke mad cest I do it the best don’t do coke I just like to smoke me and my friends we get by gettin high so legalize it donât scrutinize it I like to skate and often masturbate it feels good I guess it should I stroke it sometimes choke it when I’m sick I play with my prick he’ll be my friend right until the end and that’s the way it should be so very easy so live life not in strife but be glad not sad and live it to the fullest shout outs mY self John, Mellisa, Eddie Murphy (evil ass), Robert Smith and the rest of the cure, bone thugs, mob deep, Extra pepperoni man and so the world is turning past my anus and I spin in the vortex of madness because my mother is getting fatter and fatter in the whole eternity of masturbation madness the artsy dotsy killer whales and all that must suffer and so in this sea of hell  we all live within a glass box of shit as in you are welcome to my big box of shit so poop on fat boys and see that it is really when your neck is snapped that you get the ultimate orgasm, as in the masturbation navigations of levity shmevity and all the hell on earth of  cyberpimps lords of our penises to jerk off all over cumming on the great white sands of mother earth to see the elevation of my great RED EYE penis head in all the hell of company of heaven to see or not to see if i may be so bold to say that we are all indeed in hell HELL HELL AND SO I PRAY TO YOU THAT WE find a solution to our problems of all that I see and hear in the vast wasteland of jissom masturbation jissom masturbation CUM CUM CUM all over my dog and see that it is all a big lie what in the world do they have to say about me i don’t see them in the same light that everyone knows i see myself oh my god i am myself see me in this light And it was and then seemingly before they even realized what it was that was going on, their bodies were being controlled, they were being taken over they no longer had control of any of their actions, they were prisoners inside their own body and their was nothing that they could do or say about it they suddenly realized what it was like to be: in a coma, paralyzed, and just on the outside for the first time in their lives, they were conscious but just not able to control what was going on they could see and hear everything as well and for the first time in thier lives, they were not the center of attention, they were not the reason that people were there the people were there to see and hear things but they had no control of what they did they now felt the same way as the poor children that they had picked they finally understood what it meant to be misunderstood test test if periods are not allowed in the SENTENCE, why are they in the sentence? This is PRIME collectivism, bringing the sound and the fury to a monitor near you I WONDER IF ANYONE HAS EVER READ THIS SENTENCE FROM BEGINNING TO END I MUST ADMIT I TRIED BUT TO SAY IT WAS A CONFUSING EFFORT WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT REGARDLESS I FELT COMPELLED TO ADD MY TWO CENTS WORTH WHICH IS BEATS ME HAVE FUN EVERYONE AND BY THE WAY MARTY STUART RULES thats because it is a collaborative sentence, one cannot possibly read it alone, silly i didn’t have anything to write, but i wrote something anyways; in that way, i wasn’t unlike most of my colleagues How’s school? right my little cabbage, my sweet aren’t I right here with with, haven’t I been here with you all these years, from that afternoon when we met in Paddington Station and rode past our stop (snogging in the back of the car), haven’t we held on to each other, close as two commas, two peas in a pod, there in that cafe in Russel Square and in the long stumble up Blackboy Hill, all the ups on the Downs, together too much, too much of a much - too much of a time, too much snow, too much too much, it isn’t all amplification, a lot of it is discourse, or dat course, but we had another course we could have had, when we came to America, we could have stayed in Bristol but then you wouldn’t be here and I wouldn’t be here and perhaps I would’t have digressed back there and would have missed all that I have seen once upon a time there was a king who decided to search for Douglas Davis but his messengers kept returning with too many news about that item for the king to understand where to turn, the king then decided to gallop away on his black horse and search by himself; he scrolled through endless mountains and valleys and crossed innumerable rivers and oceans, he encountered so many sage men and women that he lost track of the eternal truth he had previously been the holder of; it was at the corner of a street, where a child was playing with a stick and a pebble, that the king fell from his horse and with his face in the gutter saw in the flow of rainwater dirtied by the poverty of the neighborhood - he saw a glitter in which a universe of games and mirrors and theatrical events suspended between laughter and sorrow hopped around circling upon themselves; the king then wondered whether he had changed and found that instead he was still the same; this sameness irked him and intrigued he decided to return to his mansion; there he found nothing had changed bu a letter from Mr Davis was attending him in his mailbox; opened, the missive stated that George Maciunas had been looking for an image of real simple stuff and had not been able to detect it in this world of ours; the king contributed a yawn and Lucio Pozzi appeared in a globe of TV screens rotating near the ceiling of the king’s halls - that’s when silence fell upon this episode of the great forlorn stream of living, that’s when memories and forecasts collapsed into one another stopping time for just a fragment of an instant inside the world’s longest sentence, oh, no wait, sorry, my mistake this is a desperate (pathetic) attempt at immortality I bet you fall in bed too easily With the beautiful girls who are shyly brave And you sell yourself as a man to save But all the money in the world is not enough I bet you’ve long since passed understanding What it takes to be satisfied You’re like a vine that keeps climbing higher But all the money in the world is not enough And all the bridges blown away keep floating up Its cold And rough And I kept standing 6’1” Instead of 5’2” And I loved my life And I hated you Its cold, out there And rough And I kept standing 6’1” Instead of 5’2” And I loved my life And I hated you Help Me, Mary Help me Mary please I’ve lost my home to your thieves They bully the stereo and drink They leave suspicious things in the sink They make rude remarks about me They wonder just how wild I would be As they egg me on and keep me mad They play me like a pit bull in a basement, and for that I lock my door at night I keep my mouth shut tight I practice all my moves I memorize their stupid rules I make myself their friend I show them just how far I can bend As they egg me on and keep me mad They play me like a pit bull in a basement, and for that I’m asking, will you, Mary, please Temper my hatred with peace Weave my disgust into fame And watch how fast

if I’d known How that would sound to you I would have stayed in your bed For the rest of my life Just to prove I was right That it’s harder to be friends than lovers And you shouldn’t try to mix the two Cause if you do it and you’re still unhappy Then you know that the problem is you And it’s true that I stole your lighter And it’s also true that I lost the map But when you said that I wasn’t worth talking to I had to take your word on that But if you’d known How that would sound to me You would have taken it back And boxed it up and buried it in the ground Boxed it up and buried it in the ground Boxed it up and buried it in the ground Burned it up and thrown it away You put in my hands a loaded gun And then told me not to fire it When you did the things you said were up to me And then accused me of trying to fuck it up But you’ve never been a waste of my time It’s never been a drag So take a deep breath and count back from ten And maybe you’ll be alright And the license said You had to stick around until I was dead But if you’re tired of looking at my face I guess I already am But you’ve never been a waste of my time It’s never been a drag So take a deep breath and count back

times Stratford-On-Guy I was flying into Chicago at night Watching the lake turn the sky into blue-green smoke The sun was setting to the left of the plane And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow In 27-D I was behind the wing Watching landscape roll out Like credits on a screen The earth looked like it was lit from within Like a poorly assembled electrical ball as we moved Out of the farmlands into the grid The plan of the city was all that you saw And all of these people sitting totally still As the ground raced beneath them thirty thousand feet down It took an hour, maybe a day But once I really listened, the noise Just went away And I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie 500 video The stewardess came back and checked on my drink In the last strings of sunlight, a

ACROSS THE CRACKLING FOREST AND NEARER TO THE VAST STREACH OF PARCHED GRASSES DRIED AND WITHERED BY THE SUN SHE REMEMBERED HER HOME AND HER DOG ROVER AND THE ANTFARM SHE LEFT BEHIND AND A SMALL TEAR FORMED IN HER EYE BUT THE PARCHING WIND OF THE PLAINS DRIED IT BEFORE IT EVER HAD A CHANCE TO EXPRESS HER LOSSES FOR HER SHE WOULD NEVER SEE AUNT BETTY OR EAT BACON UNLESS SHE COULD FIND A WILD PIG, THEN A THOUGHT OCCURED TO HER, AND SHE WENT ON A HUNT TIRELESSLY DAY AFTER DAY SHE HUNTED THE ELUSIVE WHITE SWINE UNTILL ONE DAY SHE SPOTTED IT ROOTING AND RUNTING ON THE GROUND AND SHE CLIMBED UP IN A TREE ABOVE THE SWINE AND POUNCED ON IT FROM ABOVE BITING INTO IT’S NECK AS IT SQUEELED FURIOUSLY, HER TEETH DOVE DEEPER UNTILL SHE FOUND THE NECK WHICH SHE CLASPED IN HER MOUTH AND WITH GREAT FORCE RIPPED FROM THE SWINES BODY, THIS MAY SEEM A BIT GREUSOM, BUT IT WAS THE WAY NATURE INTENDED IT MAN AND BEAST FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL, AND SHE LICKED HIS INNERDS CLEAN AND WAS SATIFIED, SHE WAS OFF TO HER NEXT ADVENTURE, HER NEXT HUNT AND ANOTHER DAY IN THIS WILD PLACE SHE HAD YET TO FULLY DISCOVER Wooooooooooooooow I fell all special now that I’ve found this page and contributed and people all over the world did too but I should say something important and intelligent so here’s a thought I thought I would just share with you real quick and that’s live fast, die young and leave a good looking corpse cause that’s whats really important in this world after all cause life is like a sexually transmitted disease and no one really wants it anyway, wow, what an amazing way to just vent all those depressing feelings I’ve been feeling all my life but then is this nuts or something, how can people actually read all this oh well I guess I’ll leave my mark here and die happy cause I left my mark on the World (wide web) and although I’ve done that a little, no ones going to read this far anyway, I don’t know why I’m bothering to add in my own part except that this is TOO COOL TO PASS UP I mean, wow, look at all this and this whole thing is just so LONG and it could just keep going, does anyone know when it was started I wrote this in 1997, so I just wanted to know, okay this is the one spot on the net where you can just blather on and on and nobody will ever notice because they probably all said the exact same thing and I like how it begins with sort of obscure arty statements but it says everything that ever really needed to be said but I digress because we all know how cool this is anyway, so there’s no real point to ending this thing as it could just keep going as long as somebody can support the page so it will live in immortality and I thank the faeries they are the ones who give us everything and if you disagree you can just kiss my *ss cause I don’t care what you think and the director the drama guy can just go for all I care because he totaly screwed me over for the musical and he’s a bastard anyway, and now the whole world knows it ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha now I feel a lot better this is almost as good as the couch of contemplation and it doesn’t really matter any way because I’ll just annoy him until he realizes that I’m not just going to go a way any time soon even though that seems to be what he really wants cause I know he doesn’t like me he gave me a D in English and he’s just stupid but everyone else is nice so its doesn’t matter what he says cause they all like me anyway and I could go on forever you’d think that someone who’s spent their entire life pretending to be someone else could be themselves for just one moment even if it is just for an audition or something stupid like that and I just cant get anything right any more, everything I do I screw up and my bastard little brother just gets everything he wants and everyone loves him saying he’s such a sweet little boy when he’s really just a pimp and I really hate him I’d like to bash his head against the wall several times then throw him out into the street so mandy can run him over a few times while her boyfriend laughs cause he really deserves it even though no one else seems to love him because he’s just so smart and so wonderful and I’m just a stupid who never does anything that she’s supposed to do and just uses her time to write stories and finds comfort that no one on the net knows who she really is and she can just do what she’s always done only in reverse because instead of being like everyone else I can be who I really am and It doesn’t matter cause they don’t even know who I am and this is all just a cherade anyway and I think I’ve gone on for long enough because I feel really stupid now for writing all this but it doesn’t matter any way because if anyone does read this far it’ll all flow together and they wont remember a word of it, I love this page it is my savior thank you all, of course, they said (i was listening today) we cannot possibly .lesbian and proud, adhereing to teh concepts of safe, sane and consensual which ought to be the acknowledged foundation of every human relationship (and yes, some with dolphins and possibly the entire world before we destroy it in our endless needs) [by the way, i knew that was a typo, something i am quite famous for and i would be feared dead if one of my soliquies did not contain such mangled articles] bring your heavy thoughts, your deepest dreads, your conscious desperations of yuppie fatalism that you never will get that promotion or what if you do - bring these to me and i shall whip them out of you, take you out of your head and into your heart, break and bleed you until you discover yourself again and again until you are convinced of it, i do this not out of intimidation, nor meanness, nor a secret warped desire to harm, but because those whose souls hunger for purity see in me the possibility of true existence what their soul craves but the heart fears - the theory and practise of bdsm involves so much more and less that just the popular fetish view of leather and steel, but so many people will never know who need to because of the guilt and prejudice we invest our children with at the hour of their birth and every moment thereafter; we who give lip service to the beauty and potential of every child but can barely spare an hour a day on our own much less those even more in need break the cycle of ignorance and raise your children and theirs in full awareness of their abilities and desires; those who are taught well and give the chance to reflect, to create, to think for themselves and change their decisions, those who are given the opportunity to read, to seek for knoweldge without preconceptions or guilt will grown to be healthy and aware adults this is maybe the closest i’ll ever get to writing the great celtic-italian-dutch-swedish-norwegian- converted jew /american science fiction novel and i’m not ready, i tell you, i’m not ready- my head is light, my ears are tired and no one knows where i am - it is amazing the disipline the elimination of a period imposes upon your thoughts and wordsmith rhythms, so that the natural stops and starts are lost and you wander even furhter from a final, declarative stop as those forced upon you by the unnatural scholars who we are pleased to call high school english teachers but who are we to say what their dreams were and what our might have been had we just one more minute to make up our minds, one more technicoloured adventure, one more friend to pull us into the glorious light and love of eternity; goddess i who am no more a paragon of punctuation than ee cummings nearly emplaced within a period, may the web forgive me! JUST adding my thoughts to this endless flow of confusion, a chaotic harmony of voices, people stopping their hectic lives to take time to listen to others, adding thoughts, feelings, making connections between people who will never know eachother, we are all connected, yet we strain to segregate ourselves from the world, wanting to say HEY, HERE I AM but being lost among the many other voices doing the same, only because we speak and expect to be heard yet don’t hear what others speak, STOP listen to the world going on around you, take a deep breath, smile, the world is not on your shoulders actually, you’re sitting on hers :-) JUST adding my thoughts to this endless flow of confusion, a chaotic harmony of voices, people stopping their hectic lives to take time to listen to

networks and Linux for days on end with no sleep at all or hope for a social life for the next several months to come, comes the culmination of many keypresses, backspaces and yellings of the word damn, “Hello from Conway, Arkansas” which means nothing more than nothing as we allow the sentence to continue, which causes us to wait until we hear from the next contributor who says, so that’s the way that things tend to work, they go, and they just keep going, like some cosmic energizer bunny, lost in a sea of hopefullness and joy, never knowing what lays just around the corner, or imagining that there could possibly be any other possibilities to entertain in this present reality, so I better go to Texas Annies before Tovah gets bored m is also for mice which scurry around my blistered feet and tickle and bite and scratch - m is also for money which ruins life and makes some people selfish and unthoughtful- m is also for mother, who we love and love and love - m is also for mind which I never know if he is controlling me or I am controlling it m is also for mice which scurry around my blistered feet and tickle and bite and scratch - m is also for money which ruins life and

sound of a high hat three times) I LOVE NNY AND NNY LOVES ME so there the date is july seventh, nineteen-hundred and ninety-seven and how should we all continue if writing this sentence which has a number of full stops in it earlier in the text which many of you must have noticed although I doubt that anyone has solemnly read the whole rubbishy text writes John Single Martyn Roberts of London England who is 58 years of age and curious that so many of us have such little to do that we spend our time writing this rot which would make my friend Larry Wolf of Louisville vomit with shame and that is quite enough from this old fag I never knew how many people could waste their time as I have over several weeks trying to get to the end of this sentence which has several full stops or periods as you yanks call them from some cunt in Norway who cannot write English - which is not surprising I expect though, that like so many people from that partof the world he or she sees themselves as experts in language - may the Lord preserve us from such pedants - nevertheless it has been fun and the person who wrote that they got here by accident when looking up “cunt hair” in a search engine (see entry above) which is hysterically funny and now it must be a woman I think has put in two midgets butt-fucking so that anyone searching for that on a search engine will also end up here - now that’s the sort of really funny thing that makes me believe that there is hope for humanity - and then there’s the guy who tried to screw us all by planting a false box - I hope this isn’t it - so good bye and hail and farewell thee well from this tired old 58 year old faggot in London England by the name of John Single Martyn Roberts, OBE - and may God Bless you all And then I ran into an old friend who used to be occupied by an alien mind but now he was just normal, driving a rich man’s cadillac and fucking his bosses wife on the weekends while the old man passed out on the cabana HELLO, I said, can you score any bicycle and he said hey man Im not into that anymore Soon the booth was filling with flies Against all odds I was in san pedro again, driving a wingtail chrysler like a bat with 4 or 8 police cars chasing, their blue cherry bomb lights errily lighting up the narrow cobblestone lane as I urged the massaged 440 to greater exertions Damn thing accellerated like an Apollo but was a pig in the curves- If I could only make the freeway I reached under the passenger seat and pulled the very stiff lever just before I got to the last curve The drop box sprayed its load of 3 gallons of dirty oil and 5 lbs of roofing nails like a leaden comets tail I laughed as the cop cars careemed and crashed and burned Motherfucking idiots unfit for ordinary life, deserve whatever misfortune comes their way and then some this is the end of the sentence the rest does not belong here next part of sentence next part of sentence Life is too short for our interest in everything I do not think there is anything more interesting than a human being Han, Eun-Mi, Taugu City, South Korea tel 82-53-476-0303, fax 476-0304 so so so dehydrated and why are my toes always so

not read the whole thing before i wrote because that would be the thing to do but my eyes were seeing grey and neon green and i didnt thing it was very healthy anyways this is better i haven’t let myself ramble write in a long time because i was beating mysewlf up with it and now it is better and easier and doesnt alwasys lead the same place because i dont let stubborn thougfhts take over because ive learned to relax and take perspective remembering at all times that there are bzillions of them ‘cause thats very important and speaking of perspective one of the most valuable things ive ever learned was from miss mcgloin: self-fufilling prophecies- the reason i don’t watch the news because the fewer people who do the better the world can be as an afterthought read cordwainer smith obviously statues of elephants tumult like aerospace if i’ll keep collaborating on this guinness sentence while you’re dining on your guinness cuisine, and so once upon a time there was a fluffy No one finds me here in this sentence of mixing peers,not even I nor the closest dear,In eyes flooded with liquid fear is tides of courage rushing near the shore apon where we STAND STILL,and ask if we’re overcome by desire, MILLIONS OF MEN sleep while the mind is manipulated to the point they forget where they came from, Lost in demanding thrill, dont ponder the motive nor the frisky kill,remember you are here a part of the CONTINUIM, EVERY word is a MILE is a word towards where you came from every choice IS a war of SEPERATION every decision is a part OF ETERNAL IMAGINATION your eternal image I Nation this is my part for the continual relation that partakes from CHIVO@N-LINK.COM, just a part of our eternal IMAGE I NATION as we are alone together so as i rounded the corner, with a chisel, be cause it was sharper before, now soft now, now soft, now soft, now, soft what can i say, let me take a drag of my certain doom, my death to physical character, and life to mental freedom, chiquita bananas, quite possibly the worlds perfect food, food form thought if this really is it must be eight miles long or longer i wait to find the end or where is this, the middle, time to submit to the digital age, where do you, we, i go from here, watch for the bang when its all collected in Here’s a poem I wrote yesterday based on that tired old beaten horse of Joyce Kilmer, “Trees” “I hope that I will always see / Among the trees the separate tree / The tree whose branches do not spread / Symetrically above my head / The tree whose ordinary leaves / Are less than flames, or gems, waves / The tree that looks a bit run down / One that will, in time, fall down; / A living thing not unlike me / That, before death, has time to be.” which begs the question is a collaboration such when not all the collaborators know or not nor write or didn’t, can’t stop or start, chart or follow, so someone thinks this is rubbish and can’t imagine anyone reading this, what’s the goal, hello from Mukilteo and ocarina heaven and be a part, apart from one somes and two some and some somes, some say you will or don’t, just let the world know soon, ok there is absurdity in here My hand still has chalk on it but that’s Ok, 10 cents a minute for a bit of fun waiting in line at the pool hall I woke and my nose was orange then I remembered I ate cheetos the night before it’s still here, hello from the westies however, you can’t erase me DOUGLAS DAVIS IS A FRAUD WHO TRIED TO USE ME he never listens, but often speaks His hearing aids are no aid at all He might as well turn them off He hurt my feelings when I was vulnerable and tried to push me into making a decision about sleeping with him when I liked him intellectually, but otherwise found him R E V O L T I N G I went to his studio on Wooster one night unannounced, because I was feeling so disenfranchised I thought as an outsider Freak, he would understand and be philosophical, but instead he pressured me to decide whether I would have a sexual relationshjp or not I hope you’re reading this, Douglas There are a lot of sensitive younger women like myself out there who appreciate the care and sensibilities of an o l d e r MAN who knows how to at once comfort and seduce But no One strike and you’re out with old Douggie To high up on his horse to see the ground anymore So here’s a screamin’ tip from a woman Doug met by answering an ad in The New York Press Match personals section: YOU aren’t the only one who can make art, buddy I’ve got more art in my asshole than you do in your whole inflated head carleton college has been here and briefly we were smothered by a torrent of thousands upon thousands of tiny hairless hola seniorrrrrrr como esttas estoy bien see the colors and feel the blue, swimming, floating, drowning, dinking So we’re all talking about this sentence and it just keeps going into infinity and now that I’m typing I feelthe need to babble along with the trend, but altough this is very connected it’s pretty dam distant too but I love the length and imagine it stretched out in little black characters in space style? Finding his way into the realm of the subway web Jeff moved forward with caution, only to realize the anxiety of this containment could not be controlled, his fear unabated causing frequent tremors and cold sweats When he could comfort himself momentarily he could then begin to have some hope, now while deep in thought he could only hope that he would find safety in his deliberate and careful movement, it had been at least six hours since he last saw Catherine, lying asleep beside him, her mouth positioned in a odd but relaxed manner as if she were dreaming of some dreadful situation Jeff and Catherine’s sexual tryst was now only a distant memory, he could still remember the manner in which she had initiated the whole scene, acting as though it might well be their last, a nice memory but one which he felt drained on more than juice, Too bad that he could not stay to enjoy more but that could have meant doom for the two of them, for sure, now how to get out of here, and hopefully find his way back to Catherine I cannot believe this sentence thing, it seems so huge, so immeasurable so many people have contributed there personal thoughts and words how long can such a phenomena continue how many more people like me will stumble upon the longest collaborative sentence in the world and add their twopence worth and then trot off to continue there lives as before who can say what will happen to this sentence to the people who have contributed to it who can tell become alive, like william shatner’s hairpiece, and pursue the two-fold thought just be free and as the dog was about to be crushed underneath the ever-nearing wheels of the 18-wheeler that was barreling towards him at a seemingly impossible rate, his mind turned to the cat he had so heartlessly and cruelly chased up the tree the other night, and he thought what do you mean when you ramble on and on, what you may think is nonsense, train of thought automatic writing is really a window, a stain on the page that came straight from your brain remember me i am bif spiffy bif@cryogen(dot)com and this is what was said: this sentence is busy, i didn’t get a chance to finish because the Third Great War of the century is almost upon us, set in motion by those faceless practitioners of black magic who twist global history to their mysterious ends, those who place their servants in positions of influence and power, those who, at the end of the First War dictated the 1918 armistice so as to plant the seeds of the Second War and who then arranged the creation of Israel so as to plant the seeds of the Third, those who assassinated Rabin and put their servant Nethanyu, that paragon of dishonesty, into a position where he can launch the Third War, the Greatest War, setting Islam against Israel, which is to say against America, and now the die is cast and the players are in their places, and of course this, the longest sentence ever written, proves without the slightest doubt that there is no God, god, Gods, gods, everlasting beings, forces, force for good, origin of life person, and negates the silly people who say “it must have been started by someone or something?”, “couldn’t have just been an accident!”, “had to have been designed”, “must have a meaning”, “otherwise why are we here?”, “you can’t believe everthing Scientists say/write”, and so forth and on and on and “Darwin was wrong” and the following also confirms this fact because this sentence evolved and is not being designed by any super intelligent being and may eventually mean something and even achieve something and Oh my, after reading three docs that contain about all that I could ever imagine saying in improvisation off the top of my head I begin writing and now my own two sense cents scents get addled to this sentence “it must be a ploy,” il pense quand il avait recontre la space de la sousmission und commense d’ecrire in la francaise mauvaise that he only half remembered from school so long ago but only now at hand at hand the masterbation of words as grafetti slime as seminal seminal signals from the ovular oval spiral double helictical shapes that passed across the screen and jjoinoined the cybercommunity in its orgy of verbalized improvisaton; but no no no it could not be enough This creation is more wonderous then words of this day and age, maybe someday when we are all old and gray, one of us will look back upon our time when life was fun and simple, why are we here? and it’s definitely Spring today in Middle America, and I’m getting ready to leave for my studio where I have to begin getting ready for an art show in the Fall, meaning I have to start on a whole bunch of paintings and the trouble is, I have so many ideas I don’t know which to try out, and anyway my work lacks focus and consistency, just like I do, but then I love to play, for I think play is the highest form of being human, and why do we have to be so serious all the time; I mean, if I can seduce people into playing, then I think I’ve been successful, just like when some of my clients (I’m also an art therapist) suddenly begin to be creative and spontaneous, I feel like shouting “HURRAY,” and I feel like the world will be OK, even though it can be a pretty grim place too, and so many people have already asked why it’s so grim in this sentence because of course it’s a universal question possibly it’s the same people who put periods in this sentence all the time; I have to wonder, as others have, why they do that, I mean, why bother to collaborate in the world’s largest sentence only to put periods in it, and I guess I think it’s that thing about being a spoiler, and I recognize the feeling, too, just of wanting to spoil the game, and I wonder if it has something to do with the inability to play, or maybe is it a playful thing after all in this phazed out plane of the performances of the dead hello i am the last of it and would the bloody arse who keeps filling up the pages with crap please stop it; dear god look, a period, j/k i cannot even think to begin to start where where to start hello my name is mrs nesbitt but i am not really mrs nesbitt im her dog bwah ha ha and it has just occured to me that i have not used a single punctuation mark since i started this stupid thing so here In the beginning was the plan; then came the assumptions; and the assumptions were without form; and the plan was completely without substance; and the darkness was upon the face of the workers; and they spoke among themselves saying: ‘it is a crock of shit and it stinketh;’ and the workers went unto their supervisors, and sayeth: ‘It is a pail of dung, and none can abide the odor thereof;’ And the supervisors went unto their managers and sayeth unto them: ‘it is a container of excrement, and it is very strong, such that none can abide it;’ And the managers went unto the directors and sayeth: ‘it is a vessel of fertilizer and none can abide its strength,’ and the directors spoke amongst themselves, saying to one another: ‘It contains that which aids plant growth, and is very strong;’ And the directors went unto the vice presidents and sayeth to them ‘It promotes growth and is very powerful;’ And the vice presidents went unto the President, and sayeth unto him, ‘This new plan will actively promote the growth and efficiency of this company, and certain areas in particular;’ clean once in a while i am here on january 26, 1998, typing these words out in the Knowledge Union at Parsons College in New York City and this sentence must be pregnant as it has not had a period in a long long long long long long long long long long long time When I move back, I imagine not finding what I have passed and forget the future space -MENTAL ILLNESS IS THE ROAD TO FREEDOM, QUESTION THE UNQUESTIONING OF YOUR MIND- hey you big star tell me when it’s over hey you big mood guide me to shelter cuz i’m through when the two hits the six and its summer cloud come shove the sun aside i think god is moving its tongue there are no crowds in the strees and no sun in my own summer the shade is a tool a device a savior see i try to look up to the sky but my eyes burn cloud come shove the sun aside but its inside forever and longer without a trace of guilt, not a stain of the eye or flex of the jaw you’re one tough son of a bich my friend, to not even react when i burst this ballon by your ear you’like a rock, and i’m going to braek you if it takes me all day gosh it necessary to have all this vidual gunk when yew jes’ writin a little ol’ sentence, sentenced to 10 years hard time for crashing my browser its getting so nobody can say nothing nomore without somebody taking notice I year theys going to clamp down hard one day and send us all out to the fields to pick cotton this would not althogether be a bad thing as we would not have to worry so much about watching our weight I hope this is innerestin’ enough because if it ain’t, there is not a damn thing I can do about it so wipe your mouth after you finish your fried chicken ‘cause the ants can’t see where the tent poles are i am a little put out also at those who succumb to early to the malaise of modern life I think it is necessary to keep trying to do things until at least 35 before settling down to watch television and play on the computer for the duration when I was a lad we had our own forks and the elements above us but of course that was a long time ago and a hard time we had of it too that time it was infinitesimally different from now considering that i never was a lad being female except possibly in previous incarnations if you believe that kind of junk, think I’ll test out this submit button before goin’ much farther with this Come on already, give me something NEW you owe me two hundred dollars you owe me two hundred dollars this is cool it really goes on for infinity huh wow noooo the monkeys, all over me HELP HELP HELP isn’t is annoying when the sentence goes no where well who the hell is really gonnna take the the time to read this oh well it is still damn cool you know, maybe I’m addicted to this expensive habit: make it stop please no matter no matter pie skewed it isn’t rare (or even as rare as the word rare would be if I hadn’t just said the word rare four times) that a man finds himself in a bind, but what is most compelling about the (say) animal of Time (as opposed to the machine of Time or the nurse of time or the lettuce of Time) is that it can slink away, leaving either a trail or at least the idea that a trail MIGHT exist, even if it doesn’t which of course it doesn’t, having just gone over that I have to say that (again) it isn’t rare: Man A (bald and standing on a train track) sees Man B (balding and standing on a train track) and assumes that a mirror has mysteriously appeared IN AIR as though nature had suddenly become concerned about its “look” when of course that doesn’t happen as often as those who are apt to think it does think such stupid things, Nature being a certain kind of math done up in cellulose and meat, and that’s the way (uh huh uh huh) I like it, except I don’t really like the Nature as everyone else defines it: the Great Outdoors to me is a waste of space, and though I can appreciate all the marvelous benefits of the sun, I wish it would perform them in the dark, because the sunlight is distracting me from the pure art of hiding in plain sight and it glares and it burns and it seems to attract flies and lakeside louts who yell just to be noticed in their healthy bullishness and then my corner of the world gets filled up with their corner of the world only they don’t fit together and I’m left feeling outgunned while they’re left feeling exactly what they’re thinking which is a certain brand of nothing with an expensive glaze that somehow always looks cheap and so I’m left to my own devices, and the only device I can find is a guillotine, a rusty one at that and I am sitting here (finally calming down) considering its uses both personal and social Aren’t you coming to the door with me? The ramblings of a confessed lover Dear people this is just a student that has gone between colleges and has no idea of what to do perhaps you can help me I am using this as my personal confession I am in love with a girl, she is wonderful, funny, smart, beautiful, caring; absolutely everything you could want in a girl but I don’t think that she knows that I am this interested in her, we went to school together last year and that’s when I really got to know her, I would like her to know that I do have strong feelings about her, and also want her to know that I am always thinking about her; I just can’t tell her though, she had a boyfriend when we first met and I was ok with that, I wanted her to be happy so it was ok especially since I couldn’t tell her my feelings; you see I have no backbone what so ever (figuratively that is) and I would rather be friends with her than have her say that she doesn’t have feelings for me and then have that wierdness that goes with that; she makes me smile even thinking about her; actually I can tell you her name, it’s Cristina, just like that you now can think of her, she has long dark brown hair, about 5’6” (not real sure though), athletic, she wants to be a writer (last I knew), beautiful face and eyes (eyes are one of the things I look at first in a girl) though I am not sure of the color of her eyes (I think they are brown) anywho not the point, she likes the same kind of music I do (Supertramp!!!)  and she makes me happier than anyone else can, so you see that I would hate to lose her as a friend or even make it uncomfortable for either one of us, ack, I don’t know what to do, I have talked this through with many of our friends and they all tell me to just bite the bullet and tell her but I am not sure due only to the friendship that may be lost, btw if anyone else out there is actually reading this, this makes a really good confessional, mostly because I am pretty sure no one I know will read this, if they do, oh well thats life and that is how things work Let’s sing a little song (ready (question mark, I don’t want to put any ending punctuation in it, tee hee) When I was young it seemed that life was so wonderful a miracle oh nevermind the point is that I am running out of time and out of brain power, I stayed up last night till round 3 doing a couple of lab reports that I know aren’t very good but will hafta do for now, anyways I needed to get up this morning around 6 and that leaves me tired, welp I will leave with what I know about life, no matter how tough things are they will get better, and no matter how good things are they are bound to get worse, and no matter how good you are there are better, and no matter how well you do you can try harder, but don’t go overboard just relax and let the world take you with it, it is much less stressful to let time go by itself than to race it, that is all and thankyou Bob D Janitor (not real name but will answer to it) shake the dreams from your hair my pretty child, my sweet, choose the day, choose the sign of your day, the days divinity somehow better?    one just can’t stop to be amased, it’s like life itself is’nt it, it just goes on and on and on and on forever like the counting of the grains of sand in the deserts of our souls never ever ever have I seen anything like this, it’s possible that that cuold be tru all my life, one doesn’t know does one, that what I allways say to myself, because talking to my self is something I enjoy Oups I’m not supposed to admit that, am I, no ‘cause then everybody will get those strange looks in their eyes, and that’s something i DONT like really not never ever ever have I seen anything like this, it’s possible that that cuold be tru all my life, one doesn’t know does one, that what I allways say to myself, because talking to my self is something I enjoy Oups I’m not supposed to admit that, am I, no ‘cause then everybody will get those strange looks in their eyes, and that’s something i DONT like really not never ever ever have I seen anything like this, it’s possible that that cuold be tru all my life, one doesn’t know does one, that what I allways say to myself, because talking to my self is something I enjoy Oups I’m not supposed to admit that, am I, no ‘cause then everybody will get those strange looks in their eyes, and that’s something i DONT like really not Ok I submit I can’t go on I must go on I’ll go on, go on and on and the endless sentence is strangely dotted with fullstops so on and on and so when I finish browsing the sentence and decide to contribute to it, I wonder does this make me part of some great thing, a global online community, or is it just another ego pellet, so I can say in the lunch room, Yes, I’m cool, I added to the interminable sentence, and now I don’t need to check Netscape’s “What’s Cool” anymore because why would I need someone telling me what’s cool, anyway oh, hello,it’s time to become part of the sentence oh, hello,it’s time to become part of the sentence I know the book, I know the books you read, I know all There is no trilateral commission, only the librarians which know the books you’ve read so i’m sitting @ home again, againOh, but “The job market is great” brianna you’re breaking my heart you’re shaking my confidense daily whoa brianna i’m down on my knees i’m beggin you please to gimme a call gimme a call a man in a grey suit with the dick the size of a watermelon once said to me that the best thing a man can hope for is a bubble gum tree in his back yard but you probably already new that cuz i’m moving to montana to raise me up a crop of dental floss cuz i’m raising it up with a guy is a neat thing to meet but impossible to keep up with did you knwo oscar wilde was gay and that when shaft’s fro is placed at the center of the universe the earth will shake and the sky will burn with the souls of the unbelievers which means that bahna is safe and i can’t remember what i am talking or writing or typing about anymore so i might explode into a badazillion bits and cover your entire parking lot with my cosmic dust causing permanent damage to your cars’ sucky clearcoated paint - boy it scratches so easily, but yeah it saves them a lot of money and effort and cuts the workforce too so what the heck screw the paint scratch the paint shut up and drive and run your errands and your boring life meanwhile the Big Bananas are coming to turn the table, you won’t notice at first but they will come from down under, slowly, subtly, mathematically, and they will finally take over the entire Plaza, and shortly after that the ants will come to establish their new nests to which you won’t be granted access, despite all your attempts to bribe the pigs and then, only then, you will come to realize how happy you actually is as a totally naked nobody, without a place, without a nest, without a piece of land to call your own and perhaps more importantly not having to figure out whether you have configured the mime types correctly everytime you do the laundry, which, let’s face it, should be done without the least thought about low level system stuff as long as you’re not trying to alter your garments significantly but then I’m not a typical Megashaft user so my opinion might sound a little nonconformist - I don’t know - but I definitely refuse to reboot my apartment everytime I want to do the laundry, not matter what you, Bob or my sister-in-law thinks - it’s all about usability (by the way, I can barely breathe in here but there’s nothing I can do to open the windows - they are locked) what kind of stinking system is this anyway Today when I left the house my father, drunk again, took everything on the floor in my room and threw it on the bed, including the wastebaskets; I MUST GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE and SOON and this is not a metaphor, okay? I am coming soon but because you are neither hot nor cold but lukewarm I will SPEW you out of my mouth; but let those little kids come to me, don’t prevent them, for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as these; I am the resurrection and the life, if you believe in me you will live even if you die so don’t worry about what you will wear or how you will eat, because all those without faith in the true God worry about these things don’t even take extra money or clothes for your journey, find the good people in town and stay there healing, teaching and casting out demons from everybody in the ‘hood and if they tell you to get out of town, shake the dust off your shoes as a sign to them; I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, and it’s like a man who finds a treasure buried in a field, and he goes and sells everything he has so he can buy that field give everything YOU have to the poor and follow me follow me and let the dead bury the dead, even though foxes have holes and birds have nests, the son of man has no place to lay his head, we have to be in Jerusalem where the most religious people will kill me slowly and with public humiliation, but I will come back to life it’s more blessed to give than to receive; Before Abraham was, I am how long do I have to put up with you? a faithless generation always asking for signs and wonders and miracles; if they don’t believe Moses and the prophets, they won’t believe it even if someone were to rise from the dead when you clothe the naked, feed the hungry, visit the prisoner, minister to the sick, you are clothing, feeding, visiting, and ministering to Me but you who are laughing now will weep, and you who are full will be hungry; next time you see the son of man he will be riding on the clouds of heaven in glory with quadrillions of angels repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near, as close as your own hand not just saying those things but doing a helluva lot too at least according to these old books, which a lot of people don’t trust just because they’re old; but even if there is doubt and you had to bet, if you bet against him you may lose everything, but if you bet for him you lose nothing nothing methinks but something like the illusory sense of Freedom Trevor and Heather had when the twirling melange of Ecstasy acid weed meth coke left them tasting the bitter taste of the same taste that Jimi Hendrix died of inhaling into his longues, an Acid That don’t belong there; of course very few could tolerate this kind of thing and they began to stomp and roar and it looked like Crucifixion time all over again--but with this significant major difference, friends, the people all filled with righteous indignation and anger this time were cool, they were really cool people, not like Pharisees at all, really kind of withit and contemporary and hypertextual alternative if you get my drift-cool; What? WE NOW RETURN YOU TO OUR ORIGINALLY BROADCAST SENTENCE This IS the last dream, Wake Up! That if they were all written down, the wonderful things he did and said, Not even the longest sentence could contain them, which will be okay becuz he said I will be with you always, even unto the end of the world So there will be time after that, or rather eternity, timelessness, but that will be most excellent for there will not ever ever never be time enough for all the new things we will do with Him, you and me, us, you and me, us, i have nothing to add what could i possibly add right now it is never too late i love you love me too lets go togtherit is not sorny to say that i want to love jesus with all my heart i do i want you to love so we can o and be with him lets all be there please jesus make this work i wish i could have a bear with every single person in the world in heaven with god and we would all be happ and pure and good and forever thank you for this and that jesus Why didn’t you tell me we were running out of bibles Jesus Fucking Christ GET OFF MY ASS JUST GET OFF MY ASS and for god’s sake USE YOUR FUCKING BLINKERS WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A TURN WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THING I AM A FUCKING MIND READER Jesus people USE YOUR FUCKING BLINKERS that’s all I have to say people suck life sucks people suck life sucks but technology sucks more why must I take my life into my own hands won’t somebody help me so i was thingking dat this is a pretty weird thing going on and how cool to be a part of it considering that yuki is taking so long doing her e-mail thing or maybe just a male thing how would i know i’m only doing my own thing overhere a little bored out of my head realizing that I can’t type and that it would be a great excuse for the fact that I can’t spell either it so wonderful to have something or someone to blame things on i’d have to say that i really missed out on that as a kid cause i don’t have any siblings or anything really i used to hang out with my cousin ira but hes turned into a bad seed i saw him at the mall and i didnt even look at him i passed him and didn t say anything didnt acknowledge his exsistance i lost my other family too due to stupid bickering and it was pretty lame but i ve been having dreams lately about the whole situation and i really must thank them for the fact that they got me interested in french in the first place and now or i should say then or at least in some point in time in my life i established a curiosity about language even though i cant spell not that it matters much due to the fact that our writing system is seroiusly fucked up anyways so what was I saying What ever you know, what ever you see, let the world understand that we both are creating the future as a “we” (coming together) Chloe Quinn startled by the pure unknown fact startled by the endless suggestion and seeming there it would have have would have been there within boundless superficial senselessness there within pure seamlessness there within unfathomable quiet the sensors realized realized realized Michael 1995 feeling trapped on the lonely only planet, is there a God, if there is where is ‘he’ why is he male why are there lots of other religions, explain that, you can’t can you, hahahahahahahahahahaha, I now feel fulfilled having contributed to this sentence, says catherine, live long and prosper my little fiends, carry on my unknown buddy ol’pal I am an arcitect They call me a butcher I am a pioneer They call me primitve I am purity They call me perverted Holding you but i only miss these things when they leave Erm hi this is wierd i’d just like to tell the person who started writing in computer language tht its got a bit annnoying now I should know i’ve read the whole thing anyway this is my contribution to the page which must know be pushing about 20 pages and it is pretty cool so i would like to say that don’t you think that society today could be a liitle bit better without brand names and stuff as a 17 your old kid i know that if you don’t have the right gear then your a re riduculed as a “gippo” or whatever the slang is in your part of the world and that people really should take people at face value and also mentality like this is like a weaker form of racism as it is judging people solely by their appearence and if it is comparable to racism then it can’t be a good thing right? perhaps its sexual, and speaking of which, am very refreshed and, unfortunately, surprised at the lack of porn on here,, must be a simple reason that i am too tired (or stupid) to notice, no matter what happens in my life, i will always love Holly Rosanne Elton,

my thoughts on life if anybody reads them it will be a miricel, if this many people can join together in this rather wounderful sentence than surely we can join together to campaing to cancel the third world debt or something useful like that, I have come to the conculsion that there is no such thing as true never ending love (the sexual type not friends and family) we only think there is because we only live to be 80 or so, and that there is more to life than sitting infrount of a computer no matter how much easier it is than the outside world we must not be scared to go out and experientce life no matter how scarry the world seems we must live life as much as we can other wise whats the point? KILL ME I NEED SOME TIME ONE MORE TIME softly I’ve final found my chance, but like every other one it will be subjected the self destruction that is so completely taking over me, yes I’m slowly on the way down, like a jet fighter thats spiralling towards the ground bits falling off it and smoke billowing out, the ground looming ever closer the final impact almost inevitable, beckoning me and yet I’m struggling with the ejector seat, I’m trapped but if I struggle and fight long and hard enough I’ll be able to free myself and land safely in a soft meadow, but I’m wounded, I don’t know where or how but I know something is not right with me, I have no energy, no will, no fight, I am almost resigned to the fact I’ll crash and burn, yet there is still something making me struggle and wriggle anything to try and get out and away, my life isn’t flashing before me because I have no memory of anything I ever did so As I sit here reading these many “tongues”, I w_o_n_d_e_r what to write, a verse, or a song!    I say wait, for all the farting breath of these tardy intervals of elaborate time call upon me!”, and so he dribbles and unravels his lungs until they speak no more of walruses and kings, and in the solitary tower Philip watches and can see only pale images of would be phoneys milling in the silent middle distance untouchable unreachble though shouting and feeling and sayin why, oh why that is not what i meant at all ,so to another brother do I hand the flame and say pray lets not do it again but find some meaning in this muddle of myths and riddles and tricks that sleight and bite at every turn and divert the true pursuit of what is me and YOU - a knowledge, a foreshadowing invisible in the stygian dark until illumined by the cigarette-lighter named DEATH, and then Trevor embraces us, his face ruddy and inflamed, and we are one (not really so), and there is laughter from the slouched creature in the corner who turns to us one bad blind eye, and we see the pale rider on the municipal council bus and he is pointing the way and asking for the fare to that great bright light that hides in the oh so gentle night and trevor so this my sad end i leave it to you to sing it my friend, that until the day is once more born, this endless pre-millennium endless night, the song is unheard, but we three we happy three David, Philip and ever-absent Trevor leave thee now, tenderly, and here endeth our lesson, Did I tell you how much I love Ems, probably not, but there are some things that need to be shared Although she will probably never see this, I thought I would share this with you, From the luckiest man alive, Long live the post modern public sphere XXX oh, I didn’t write that, by the way pleh and why isn’t the word ‘pleh’ in an dicyionary I’ve ever found, it’s not like it’s never used EVERYONE has used the word pleh once, at least once in their pitiful lives if for no reason other than expressing frustration at not being able to find the right words, they’re such elusive things, words you know how when there’s one word you need, looking for, you KNOW the word but just can’t think of it, it’s right on the tip of your tongue teetering on the edge of your brain WHAT IS IT DAMN IT and then three days later when it no longer MATTERS you remember the word, what the hell is that?! through secret spies (who shall remain nameless, mainly because I canât think up any good spy-like names at the moment) it has come to my attention that we are not supposed to live to a ripe old age of 86, the human race was originally immortal, through manipulation and gradual hypnotisation, *they* have succeeded in fooling us into believing that sleep is good for us, they tell us it revitalises our energy, that it rejuvenates us, this is all a sickening plot to con us into sleeping more, what the majority of the human race doesn’t know is sleep is evil, it is what makes us grow old, sleep is the source of the aging process, it slowly sucks away our life essence, our energy, our youth, which means that without sleep, we donât age, the human race is immortal you may be asking what the point of this plan is, to fool us into sleeping, causing us to die well, the government is trying to kill us off they don’t want us to realise that they are actually all immortal themselves, having given up sleep long ago they are merely biding their time, until Earth is so vandalised and polluted that it can no longer support human life when this comes to pass, they will all jump into secret getaway spaceships and jetton off into outer space, to secret hide-a-way planets they have waiting, on these secret hidden planets they will exist for eternity, revelling in their immortality, they plan to leave us here to die, if we havenât already died in our sleep from old age, this is why they want us to age and die, if we were immortal, weâd realise that they are immortal, and would most likely assassinate them before they could carry out their plan, it is possible for us to cast off the evil oppressions of sleep, true, we could die from sleep deprivation trying, but only if we rush it, and donât do it properly, to give up sleep you slowly have to sleep a bit less each week, until eventually you work it out of your system and grow immune to the requirement of sleep, once you have reached the point where you no longer need to sleep at all you will be immortal however itâs not quite that easy, there are a few problems associated with giving up sleep and becoming immortal first of all, sleep does rejuvenate our immune system, that much is true in order to prevent becoming infected with every disease we come across and dying from a common cold, meditation is needed to replace the work that sleep once did for out immune system so an hour of meditation a day will build up our immune system as well as ease some of the strain another problem with all of us becoming immortal is overpopulation seeing Earth will quickly become too crowded, if we keep reproducing at the rate we are now, and none of us are dying some of us will be killed by cars and cancer, for there is no way to prevent that but the most common way for humans to die is from age related problems therefore, when Earth becomes overpopulated, we have to steal the government secret spacecrafts and zoom off into outer space to live on the planets they’ve found, stop laughing itâs a perfectly feasible idea we need to foil the evil plans of our superiors and seek eternal happiness on other planets, do it now!!! so there you have it folks i like to fuck and i haven’t fucked for about 2 months now i guess that it’s more like a month and a half and what with my good looks and fab body you would think that it wouldn’t be any problem unfortunately i found when i got to college that the situation is a little different than i previously thought, so then i decided to not respect the majority, (ho ho ho) and i decided to try and use my own methods which have all led to alienation up to this point, but i’m always hoping the next method will be better, see the thing is i reallly have no hope and perhaps if i had hope that would be all i need, but i need something that i don’t know what it is um, perhaps the addition was not quite as it seemed at first perhaps i’m not being an asshole perhaps it’s all in my imagination i don’t know, i’m one of the guys you know you know i keep thinking that perhaps it’s because i was taught that sex wasn’t the center of human thought and the center of our universe and maybe it’s not but i have my doubts gimme back my bulletts, put them back wherer they bel;ong gimme back my bulletts, put them back wherer they bel;ong oh, oh, okay here simply because my ‘phone rings periodically I have decided to add to this sentence but dare I do it for prosperity or another meaningless thro’ a disc beating lens I might ask, yet that is not a question that I am compelled to ask at this moment of time due to the lack of time which we have although we have all the time in the world according to an unfamous friend of mine who made me realise that I do this quite a lot for example listing endless jargon of course like ring a bop ring a bop ring a bop ring a bop ring a bop ring a bop ring a bop ring a bop ring a bop ring a bop ring a bop ring a bop ring a bop Hello, my name is Victoria, and I would very much like to be a part of this sentence, seeing as so many other people have been a part of it already and boy do I have trouble not putting periods in but I suppose that is the whole point of this excercise, right and I guess you’re not supposed to put in question marks exclaimation points or anything else of that nature kindness is extremely important did you know that ther is a pool of social kindness, and you can put into it again and again and you will always get an equal amount of kindness back, because you put some in and the pool spills over it is not necessarily direcetly connected to anything you did or necessarily connected to the same persons in any way shape or form you can think of this as pretty spirituality which, of course, it is, but it is absolutely practical also in the scientific of cause and effect, if you make one person happy, or make her world better, than she or he will be bound to be in a better mood or in a better position to do something for someone else, etcetera, etcetera until the social kindness pool spills over onto you from somewhere You do understand now, don’t you sooooo - It’s really important that we go out of our way to practice kindness God really digs it when you do, also Hello, my name is Victoria, and I would very much like to be a part of this sentence, seeing as so many other people have been a part of it already and boy do I have trouble not putting periods in but I suppose that is the whole point of this excercise, right and I guess you’re not supposed to put in question marks exclaimation points or anything else of that nature kindness is extremely important did you know that ther is a pool of social kindness, and you can put into it again and again and you will always get an equal amount of kindness back, because you put some in and the pool spills over it is not necessarily direcetly connected to anything you did or necessarily connected to the same persons in any way shape or form - you can think of this as pretty spirituality which, of course, it is, but it is absolutely practical also in the scientific Chain of cause and effect, if you make one person happy, or make her world better, than she or he will be bound to be in a better mood or in a better position to do something for someone else, etcetera, etcetera until the social kindness pool spills over onto you from somewhere You do understand now, don’t you sooooo o - It’s really important that we go out of our way to practice kindness God really digs it when you do, also I don’t know, call me weird, but I just saw the movie and I thought the Last Temptation was the LAST temptation, the one he gives in to at the end, what is your opinion? I want a name when I lose everyday I walk by a Mayan sculpture and lately it has been crying and screaming at me so I have to close my ears and my eyes when I walk by and everything else in this museum seems to be going faster and faster like all the artifacts are wondering why we haven’t learned anything from history and why we keep hurting the earth and the people and why we keep paying 2,75 for a cup of coffee in the morning when that adds up to money we could use to help save the planet collaboration a dream a myth a reality a fungus spreading hey did you hear about the one it in the upper peninsula of michigan which is where i live not the up no i am not a youper as they say i am a near detroiter yes the murder captial of the world well yeses ssssssssss anyway i was saying about the fungus this sentance and the one in the upper peninsula have a lot in common it think and so there i am thinking about spreading and how i go to thin and how far i can go really since i am already 47 years old on sunday that’s april 18, 1999 i was born sandra lee mumberson in mt clemens michigan and then i grew up and became an adult and as everyone knows that ain’t all it’s cracked up to be now is it and i wish i kneew how to change the font on this thing so people could see it better i mean that’s what i stopped at were those places where one drew attention to oneself but maybe its better to just schmooze along really someone will reead me eventuall y okay that’s the way it is the squeaky wheel gets the grease and all that and really i am pretty good at this and people have always told me so that i just can keeep going going going going going going until the world evaporates or i get tired but really i could sometimes just sleep all day long and go on and on and on that way in the dreamland and maybe something is getting done but i doubt it and now my name is sandy gerling and has been for more than twentyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy fiveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee yearssssssssss but will not be for long cuz my husband is a recovering drug addict and says i make him want to use and its all so sad isn’t it this truth to strangers and i can say anything but won’t go into my sex life or / and my wants in that area because i am of a different sensibility than taht but i will say that i doooooooo hoooooopppppppeeeeee i get some soon cuz its a tad irritating to use a vibrator all the time when the real thing would be the best i digress so on to the next bit or bits and time is running out because i have to go home and make some dinner for a frien and this has been a blast and i can’t wait to see it and just realized that there are many people i don’t want them to see this but opps too late well i guess i could take some of it out but then what fun would that be always saying nice things so to my stupid idiotic husband i work at a supermarket of bookstore you can find almost anything there if it involves the cultural mainstream you need to hunt farther to find written works off the beaten path you know i cut an evening short in order to do //////////this//////////// so what for i say need there be reason is ay so much for the small talk sitting or standing here with my two glasses of Aussie wine flowing through my blood and lust it feels good and the’y kick me out of here in a little while so on i must go bu i am lost and that’s the crux of the mmmmmmm mmmmatter i am lost my collaberation with the artistic urge came to / screeching / halt about a year ago just about a year ago just about a year back when i was thinking about painting but then it just didn’t appeal to me anymore you know like there was something else to say or write or be i ddon’t know because i am lost f o r ever or just a while i don’t know and what’s more where’s that crystal ball you know the one i hid back in the 70’s yes 70’s or maybe after that or before but no i was not a hippis but people say i look like i was one and i have to laugh cuz i was as straight as they come raising babies and such worthwhile endevours and planting green beans and morning glories which by the way take over a piece of land faster than you can hoe or till or whatever farmers do there are no shades of gray when you are lost lost is lost only and exclusively lost lost is lost on a sunny day despite what others might be saying don’t believe that everyting a person says comes directly from their own personal narrative she may be speaking for the mutitudes when she says lost is lost there is absence but never absentia there it is: while lost there is never foun i digress I DIGRESSSS the trustworthy or more peaceful type of personalities may seem to have truth captured but there is none of that truth will not be grapped and put out a s one e a s y system one day the enormous pile of goodies you have collected throughout the years and then proceeded to organize into shoe boxes of like things, simplyloses it s appeal and i don’t mean bananas, all that stuff so important at the time, holds no more interest than the daily reporting of football score in October maybe the eye has grown tired of all the pressure you have exerted upon its gelatinous mass and needs a silent retreat full of ritual and tangha bells a person may start anywhere really, then turn around and do it allover again; it could be the way a certain line curves in a painting or a shaft of light or the sound of water in the drain who knows or the sttraction might be a socio-political statement in combination wtih your own personal issues of a fragmented identity and disconnected life experience of women, that pushes you, gives you a purpuric rash and generally makes you question your sanity, these things must be addressed!!!!!! seeds seeds worms bitter drink formulating a sour taste in the gaw by gum by jolly i am lost but there was this gold bracelet once in the lost and found box at work where people leave all kinds of things and i just wanted it and no one came but i couldn’t cuz i’m a good girl yes a good girl and then someone took i\the box of lost things to the goodwill but i didn’t take the bracelet and why don’t i just have a piece of pie for christ’s sake what a whimp or a munch or tra-la-tra-la-tra-la-al-la-a any body can stay lost and let the boatsman steer you over the waterfall to a sure and swift death but to have to do it on your own is the trick and taxing part we don’t normally break for a sponser at this point in time but this is america and the buyer rules or is it the corporation and i am not getting into that arguement senseless demented how to keep sane is what i question i want things from every other catalog that comes in the mail are you gray or purple or ridgid or tempting i am just lost and lost is not found nor is it anyting but lost, She may be speaking for the multitudes when she says lost is only lost and to remember the above place where i said that there is a fungus among us and it’s not the one that grows in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan but i live in the lower peninsula somewhere around Detroit jason hansbury Phillips of Detroit, Michigan is the greatest atist in the whole world on any level critics rave over this young mans talent and rendering techniques that reflect the Afican American urban life and culture You must own an original oil painting by Jason Hansbury Phillips of Detroit, Michigan You must own an original oil painting by Jason Hansbury Phillips of Detroit, Michigan update and the light diffuses and seems to trickle down my spine, the lassitude of her latitude is fin, and soft, all these things ache And on this quiet morn, in my own quiet way, I add my love for my children Jeff and Lins bungs and lots of them Wow, at last a chance to join in with this infinite number of words that have been reeling up and down my screen for the past half an hour as I try to decipher and make sense of the endless stream of bizarre and neverending requests it seems that I feel the need to say something profound nut my intellect is not as vast and uncompromising as I would like it to be though I still have this burning desire to change what I can i think i love you (how do i love you - why won’t i christen, my awkward, inwardly twisted self won’t allow contemporary expression - i think you understand) you love me (pause), always prodding, getting closer, wanting to move me into the light (normal) and then back again (normal), i need something - to share in your pain, pain that i understand but cannot relate to - the black side - the other half - the pieces that make you whole, joy/sorrow/pain/elation - validate my need to have all of you (not just the good, of which i’m intimately familiar) - all that i want, all that i need, all that i’m willing to recipricate - all, i need all, taking, giving, all - all the schemes, ideas and and plans in your head - all the pain and sorrow in your heart, all the visions and and tears in your eyes, all the music and terror (crash, ventilating) passed through your delicate ears, sweet and bitter tastes upon your tongue - share - all - let me share in you - all - you - all - me - all Rooster! Oooh, periods are not allowed, yeh, like that solves anything yet, as we al know, the period marks the end and the end is the one thing we fear, be it the literal end of our lives or the end of something more figurative like pleasure or the ability to procreate (the interconnectedness of which will bind my soul forever, sorry to say), but really, can we ask anything else of a collaborative sentence than that it be (symbolically at least) unending, and in evidence of this I will not endeavor to change the color or format of the text presented, this is because my words (my long, meaingless words) are my contribution where perhaps there is another who contributes nothing but changes of format which is no less a contribution and no less welcome (should be at least) in this place; no I’m wrong because welcome or not it is a contribution and in keeping with the idea of the beast we must welcome all contributions; wanted, loved, crappy or of the utmost beauty, as though they were are oun, for as parts of the universe we all share (or seem to share, whatever) they indeed are our contributions, spelling missteeks and all, to have and to hold till death do us part, all of this of course assuming that there is an us and that there is more than one mind (as we understand minds) in the universe capable of making contributions- I doubt I need restate the butterfly dream- yet what can we do but make these assumptions, even while I keep saying “yet what can we “ and “still we must assume “ because the universe may be beyond questioning, but still we must make some kinds of guesses at what kind of behavior (again, doubt in the nature of behavior) will fit best withthe plan, which we must also guess at, even while we sleep and dream and copulate and plan and speak and walk and talk and write and die and live and grow and decay and what comes after and before; to paraphrase: “I came like water and like wind I go, knowing not why nor whence nor wither” and is it not beautiful how beauty lives on after its creator, ever a testament to the human spirit and all that, and how ironic for this very work to survive and speak to me today of the everlasting certainty of beauty Why are we attracted to this project,connecting to invisible humans, very possibly people we would avoid as the makers of irrelevant noises, asking from our carefully designed vacuum,needing the confirmation of continuation,frightened by our alienation,waiting, is definitely a thing of the last millennium, unless of course you prefer rough stuff to get you off Hi! Well there you go I’VE HAD DIRECTION, ITS GOTTEN me ALL KINDS OF PLACES i DIDN’T WANT TO be you must appreciate the beauty of the invisible letters immediate gratification it is love is not enough but love is everything you need don’t live with someone you don’t like even if you love them sex is important damn it and make sure you have it before you commit yourself to someone for life you can’t learn to like someone you love but you can learn to love someone you like don’t be afraid to walk away if you aren’t happy it takes more courage to walk away then to stay this is it this ain’t no dress rehearsal do it now and live your life like there’s no tomorrow because there isn’t there’s just now noo says nina says ninja says ninjabobs says but they are all me say I and I am where I am and where I go and where I want to go in the future if I only knew where that was and I shall travel and I shall rest but I would always hope to feel like me like nina bunni because that is who I am Image and the sentence continues, and now, some sad personal commentary; for three years or so, it seems that I have been in love with a girl who always treated me like shit, we were together for two and a half of those years and broke up six months ago, but I can’t seem to get over her, really, no matter how hard I try, she is still there, and I know that I should be glad to be rid of her, what with the abuse, infidelity, and mind games, but I can’t seem to do it, I thought I was stronger than that, and before she entered the picture I thought to myself every time someone talked about something like this “Gosh, that will never be me”, but now it is me and I don’t know what to do; I can’t even seem to fall in love with someone new, something that happened with alarming regularity before I met her, but she’s still in my head and still fucking me up, and I’m so afraid that she’s never going to go away- Thanks for listening, I’ll let someone else rant for a while, oh oh, repetition time- and the sentence continues, and now, some sad personal commentary; for three years or so, it seems that I have been in love with a girl who always treated me like shit, we were together for two and a half of those years and broke up six months ago, but I can’t seem to get over her, really, no matter how hard I try, she is still there, and I know that I should be glad to be rid of her, what with the abuse, infidelity, and mind games, but I can’t seem to do it, I thought I was stronger than that, and before she entered the picture I thought to myself every time someone talked about something like this “Gosh, that will never be me”, but now it is me and I don’t know what to do; I can’t even seem to fall in love with someone new, something that happened with alarming regularity before I met her, but she’s still in my head and still fucking me up, and I’m so afraid that she’s never going to go away- Thanks for listening, I’ll let someone else rant for a while, non ne posso pi…and, oh oh, here I am again, I just can’t seem to stay away but keep getting drawn back like a moth to a flame, anything that offers a shot at immortality, my own teensy-weensy place and history, and a forum in which to vent my spleen or expose my opinions to the world will do that and for even as we arise and endure, so must we all pass away, it is in the nature of the universe that people grow old and die, stars grow old and burn out, and even the universe itself must decay, but fortunately for us there are things that keep us from thinking about these very frightening realities, we can sing and dance and make love, but sooner or later it is all going to catch up with us, there is no avoiding it, there will come a day in the life of everyone and everything when tomorrow will fail to come, even the oldest tree will die, the planet will collapse, and even ideas and thoughts which have a shelf life greater than that of anything else in the known universe (if maintained properly) will fade and disappear; this sentence is a very long and enduring idea, but even it has to end sometime, it will not last forever, there will be a period eventually; and this is something we all must realize (for that way lies wisdom), but not dwell upon (for that way lies madness); one day I will be gone, and eeternity does not truly exist; in fact I don’t think that I would want it to: heaven is a very appealing concept in and of itself, but eternal heaven? and she said, oh I dunno and I said yes you do so we all got in the CAR AND WENT HOME, because obviously Judy was doing unsolicited drugs in the bathroom wihtout me and so i hit her over the head with a fish and then we’ll see who’s got the last laugh my little one, as I bite you like a parahanna on cocaine and lick my fingers as I eat your eyes like LIVER AND STUFF and then say “holy wow, look” at the sight of them all dancing NEKKID AS PAGANS IN THE RAIN OF MY CORNDOG and watching them fall is like water off a ducks back, I said to myself as I secretly packed away the childrens clothing so as to leave the country by morning, I then began to think to myself “what if the world was a circle, and in that circle was a pile of money, and seeing as the circle is around the money, as it is indeed a circle, if you try to take the money then you might find your self wondering”, I then stopped wondering because frankly, that was the most annoying thought I’ve ever had in my life and all the other corndogs out there that didn’t quite make the grade, you know the other ones that were too faaaatty or greasey or just plain cold, just like that and as I stopped thinking about it I started to sing to myself “this is the song that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friend, some people started singing it, not knowing what it was, and they’ll continue singing it forever just because this is the song that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friend, some people started singing it, not knowing what it was, and they’ll continue singing it forever just because this is the song that never ends… I THEN SHOT MYSELF TO DEATH WITH A CHROME 45 too many times I have been mistaken and too many times I have been rakin the leaves in the front yard when the weirdest thing happens and I look up to see the writting on the wall is all for me, it speaks to me, it sets me free and lets me see whats hiding in the tree and then said I hate you, I hate you all, I hate you all so very much and then I long to feel your touch, I miss you now and always will, your love to me, to death I’ll kill, the ones who look and say your name, the ones who think my lives a game, I’ll kill them all and then they’ll see, the fauxness of reality then I put down the bong and stopped being weird and shit and said what the hell was that!? it does a body good that’s for sure, and if you dont believe me just look at al Frog, cross every finger and toe that you have; after 20 years of me not holding my breath I think my mother might really finally be kicking this scumbag out of the house , then the little grey dog ran across the road and that was the last that any of us ever saw of that dang dog, last i heard he had joined the circus and was a major attraction with all the collaborating, emancipating, eating, spitting Everyday is my birthday, and I am dying to live a living death - how so alive I feel you YEARN TO BE FAMOUS, AND WHEN YOU ARE - well, who cares; be INFAMOUS, and all will know your name - what is my name; what, you say - you don’t know, bastard; oh, but you will know when I’m through with you, my friend - I’ll be the most famous person you’ve ever met, my pretty HAHAHAHAhahahahaHAHAHahAHahAH let me cleanse you blood is thicker than water but so is good vodka let us all seek and find what - WHAT - thequICkbrowNfoxjumpEdoVerthelazydog bites the leg that kicks her stop the madness: blurring the line between man and computer, my idle hands have become itchy hands and where oh where are you tonight?

without a period is a period out of a sentence with in other words, don’t worry devil-daddy, you’re still the Pope today, the rain made the world sound crisp - in precisely this particular way, which holds the promise, that summer will come again Even though you were trying to get rid of this sentence, Holocaust the port had seen better days, by any mans standards, but who is following the illustrious shadows from above we are able to communicate on the level, the highest, void of verbatim - noiseless - communicado telepathically is growing, growing, gaining strength from within; Ipso facto what to say what to say, oh - liberation now and who the fuck has a spare chicken sammich that they can pass in my direction or vincinity or close proximity or runny nose and runny yolk yes it’s quite safe to say i have a mild obsession must you rub it in stop reminding me it’s tegretol’s fault i’m pregnant, listen what do you do once you’ve done all you want to do you know that saying if you haven’t got anything nice to say don’t say anything at all, well what if you haven’t anything nice to do hmmm don’t do anything at all, that can only mean once thing stop existing If I ran the zoo smoking your hippy crack like a salt water consultant, one of these days you’ll see where you’ve gone wrong, then you’ll stand back and look at yourself and drift away to that place we all know you go to when you’re not really listening, when you just look me dead in the eyes and say “mmm hmm”, that’s when I know you don’t care, that’s where you’d found the yard sales before, and on many occasion it’d come to be you’d find a bargain, you’d see the sales, you’d grab your coat and just run, running like a mad hatter at the merchandice of slaughterhounds for the buck, it’s a sad display of sadistic clarity, my friend, it’s plainly clear as day that you lost the keyring in the car, if he’d ever remove the baby seat, maybe we’d have a ride to the carnival, but we’d be late and you know how Sandra gets when we’re late for big events, like the party last Wednesday in the folk-lore hall of the pan cake house, where were you, I had shown myself around 4:30 and been surrounded, expecting to be there with you and take the blame myself, I don’t mind, it’s just that you’d left the bar at 3 and we met at 1 downtown by the malt shop, and absolutey gravy packets, did you forget something, I didn’t know you knew philosophy like that, I didn’t know you could sing so well, I didn’t know you could fly around the dang room like you owned the place, I didn’t know you had the power to throw me down the stairs and kick my head in, I didn’t know you could do all of these things, I had no clue, why don’t you tell me these things, why don’t you trust me, why don’t you tell me why you don’t trust me enough to tell me these things, are you angry about the dog, I’m sure he’d tell you he was quite sorry if he weren’t long buried in the woods of the farm house, the old farm house I miss so much, yellow grass and all, I thought it needed more sunlight, but she just goes to show you she’s not that way, they’re not her boss, the only way I’d listen to her again, though, would be if she were to bring it all back, and both of us, you and I and vice versa, my dear, we know she lost them both and didn’t care, and it’d do in a pinch if I weren’t so uptight about my personal rights, the charred cars in the barn yard by the old elm trees we’d set aflame long ago, they’d known all along it was the old man, they knew, it’s just so much easier to pin the whole ordeal on a bunch of children, or an irresponsible parent, the family of 4 that just couldn’t, it was a heroic tale and all for naught as the field burned, the whole place and the estate, we’d left there, but you know the ice cream we found at the corner store, it won’t ever be the same, my love, it wont ever be the same when we had the manufacturing line by the river banks, it wasn’t my idea, but it went well until you told us otherwise, certainly we’d had good times together, then the bad times, you know maybe they’d outweighed the good times at times by the bad times we’d had during the good times, but it didn’t really matter, I thought you had fun, even if your father didn’t approve, it was the vertical fly wheel approach I’d used so often, backfiring on me like it usually did, one of these times I swear I’ll fix the antifreeze thing-ama-jigger, at least so it isn’t splattering the mayor, he’s not the nicest, you know we’ve got trouble, especially when he opens his cupboards at night, having to hide beneath the floor-boards was never easier since the kids moved out, now we’ve just got to find our way back to the door each time, we should get this all under control by around May, just after June, then, I’m sure we’ll have lost our grip on reality again, so by October we’ll almost be functioning at a safe level of annexing joy, just don’t ask the neighbors for your help anymore, the company functions without outter contribution, don’t forget that this time will be the one time above all the other times, that were just like that time when we were out of time, and ran the bill up to outrageous numbers, because the numbers on the check were a full house, or a three of a kind, or maybe it was a royal flush in which case I can throw my cards at you and jump up and down and scream “NICE!” and just act like the dork that I am and that I always wanted to be, for only the rodents understand me, it’s a rodent thing and no one here will ever know your highness, I never had the whole attitude thing going for me, I’m sure you understand, so it’s hard for me to try and explain all of this, it’s like a whirlwind of thought coming to me out of the blue, I don’t really know how to tell you all of this, I don’t know how to make you understand the simple fact that maybe, just maybe, you’ve got some kind of nasty green thing hanging from your nose and although I think it’s incredibly funny, watching you talk to other people like that, I just cant stand to look at it any longer or harder or else I just might have to put down this ham sammich that I am eating, the one with all the mayonaise and lettuce and bean sprouts and other assorted green sammich things, and pretend that I was never your friend and that the fact that we are sitting here together, you and I, is mere misfortune on my part, and no I dont have any kleenex but that person there has a lovely sleeve that I am sure they would loan you, if they dont take a good hard look at your face and see that atrocious thing that is now swallowing your whole head and starting to slide down your stomach and onto the floor and the chait and chair even, with all the things chair even, with all the things you told me once you’d be thinking more about my Aunt, I heard she lives down by the mill now, with Johnston, he never cared about her, he didn’t, she stayed with him all of these years due to the fact that he ACTED like he cared about her, and she’s no better, with that little fixation for gambling she has, tell me this; if he doesn’t care for her, and she knew it (which we all know she does), and she cared, why, oh why wouldn’t she have left by now, it’s by simple minded logical thinking that I’ve come to the conclusion that even though he hates her and she hates him back, they’re doing the world a favor by staying in that house all day and bickering, I mean would you rather they fought it out on the streets or stayed up there, hell, I’m just glad they both forgot your phone number 867-5309, or was it the other way around and what are you doing in there anyway, and why cant I do that too, and who said you could do that anyway, I have a lovely bottle of shampoo here in my hand, and if your aunt doesnt like it then maybe your uncle will, or maybe the cat could use it as red Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth [1m[39m then took the other as just as fair, and perhaps haveing the better claim, because it was grassy and wanted

kept the first for another day, yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back I shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence: two roads diverged in a

getting blue Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes, that have been so bedazzled with the sun that every thing I look on seemeth green So Roger Williams took the only course of action open to him: he went to England in 1644 to get a charter , i am starting to get engaged with you girl i know, i know, so you can eat lots of little fishies, well here’s a good quote: “Many departments simply don’t know where a lot of their graduates end up and some of them are scared to find out” quand le théatre de la vie sert de pretexte à l’Art, ses acteurs deviennent pour un instant seulement, des créateurs thinking of the right thing to say at a time like this is je me sens seul, et pas vraiment heureux comme ca, et surtout je me demande pourquoi ca toujours été le cas bob dylan said “to live outside the law you must be honest” vine deloria jr said “we may misunderstand, we do not misexperience” they are both right words to live by mitakiyu oyasin MICROSOFT ARE THE ANTI CHRISTS Je n’en crois rien, d’ailleurs, je ne suis pas le seul I am an evil raccoon, with no real purpose in life but to be obnoxious and piss people off to no end or beginning but mostly no in between the sheet of all the beds you never knew and everythings coming up cherry blossoms but not really cause I feel so alone here in my box of chocolates with the pretty bow on top and no real clue as to what the heck this stuff is all around me and dont stick your finger in me to see what’s inside, nooooooooo it’s all a blur and slur away with a cherry and a straw and a little paper umbrella and some bug spray which will undoubtedly get on my lips somehow and make me heave ho and bug my eyes out till the literally fall out of the sockets and roll around in the carpet and yes the carpet oh the carpet, it’s a lovely green this fall with many little black specks, wait omg they are fleas, I’VE GOT FLEAS,get them off me, ARRGH, Okay you read my mind, I think this is a horse chestnut, These people are never going to move beyond the founding, They’re going to keep tricking their interpretation so they can undermine any use made of it by anyone else they don’t like, What is your opinion (question mark) You read my mind (keep talking) It’s not only scientific interest leading me here, but my friendship with THOMAS DECKER, who is now immortal, too - I can’t end this sentence with a dot, O.K., nevertheless I make a DOT will change your life Everyday a new founding I am a poster girl with no poster, I am 31 flavors and then some, I am beyond your peripheral vision, so you might want to turn your head hey, did

are sitting here in the middle of the world’s maddest city at three minutes before midnight on july 6, 2000 oh, how mad could it posibly be without the splashes and strokes of jackson El mundo esta un lugar grande con muchas cacahuates I know you like to think you’re not leading (But you are (But you know that)) now it is july 17 in new york city 6:25 pm wenn der hahn kräht auf dem mist, ändert sich´s wetter oder es bleibt wie´s ist hi click here, for the artistic madness now i see the real beginning and it starts with To be happy you must first understand what makes you really happy In the beginning there was only water and the water animals lived in it oh, genial, je vais pouvoir dire a tout le monde ce que j’ai sur le coeur mais vous vous en foutez de toutes manieres je demenage tout le temps je n’arrive pas a rester dans un pays je suis international je suis trilingue je suis gentille avec tout le monde je suis je suis je suis seule parfois mais heureuse je trouve le monde completement dingue et surtout a NYC c’est ou j’habite and there are so many freaks freaks freaks out there just not giving a fuck about their lives and taking extasy and fucking up their minds and taking other drugs and fucking up the world consiousness with their freakiness and not caring about the environment and the children only about themselves because that’s why they take drugs they’re so damn selfish and self centered i see it everywhere and I want to throwup on all of you everysingle selfish drug user out there where’s the love for yourself if you’re messing up you’re mind and how could you love other people you make me mad mad mad and sick that’s all I have to say es todo c’est tout and I hope you get over it too what happens when i try to finish my sentence. i have waited so long It was their density Hi i guess i’m sort of OVERWHELMED by the concept of having my own words that escaped my fingertips sprawled across the internet but i do it everyday anyway and i never mind that - i’m researching this project for my degree and it’s a really strange sort of wholesome thing, that it’s just whatever the internet puts out there, it’s strange, that we lose our filter completely when we feel anonymous even if we aren’t because you have my IP & everyone else’s too but i trust you not to misuse it so thank you - i’m not really sure how to interpret the ‘never ending it’ thing, am i allowed to use ‘sentence ending’ punctuation like questions marks or periods or anything - i don’t know, maybe that’s up to me, i also liked that some people worked well with html text tags and all that and i want to too - oh god did i do it, did i do italics - i haven’t written in html in years - is a sentence ending defined by ‘ending’ punctuation, i’m sure i saw some punctuation somewhere and i’m sure nobody got sent to prison for that or anything - so what now - what do i do now - what is it that i want to actually say - i’m not really sure there’s always a lot to say - and this is sort of strange being the generative part of generative art because usually someone else decides that bit then puts it out there but this is generative-cross-interactive - maybe i should talk about myself, since that’s my biggest point of reference - is it narcissistic to talk about yourself when you only have a brief moment to talk about anything - i guess that’s subjective - but yes hi i’m emma i’m 22 and i live and breathe art context - i think i’m more interested in the purpose than the actual art sometimes and that makes me feel like i’m bad at art but i’m more and more invested in the concept that no art is ever bad it’s just a big sliding scale of subjectivity and thought and technical skill - i don’t know if technical skill is really that important actually - i’m always more interested in how art makes people feel - this art makes me feel sort of uncomfortable in that i have a space all of a sudden and i’m not sure what to do about it because i guess i didn’t think that far ahead - but it also makes me feel good & empowered because i do have a space and we all need that - i really hope these html tags work because if they don’t then it’ll look a little strange in the body of text - what else should i use my space for - world peace maybe - feed the poor - fight the system - send donald trump to jupiter and just leave him there - on a totally separate note i’m really surprised that this project only has just over 20 pages to it it was started in 1994 - oh my god i’m the same age as the project - i’m sorry to the developers who might feel a bit old reading that - is it bad to feel old - i’m sorry if i made you feel bad you are valuable because this project exists and i think it’s important - it’s like youtube comments but with less flagrant racism - i wonder how often you get submissions and how long the average submission is, is mine longer than average, shorter than average or somewhere in the average field - i wonder if the developers or administrators read every single word before they set it free on the platform - i wonder if they’ve ever censored anything - i wonder if they have censored, what their censorship matrix is, what makes a submission not okay - i think censorship would probably counter the whole point of the project though - i wonder if i can include my participation here as part of my evidence of research because i looked at a thing and did a thing instead of just reading a book and half-watching netflix - what about this project made me pause netflix - the interactivity i guess, and i wanted to see if it still existed because it was started a long time ago - i’m relieved to see that it is - i just scrolled up and saw the rule about periods uh i used a question mark is that okay i’m really sorry, but i saw others doing it, maybe i should go back and edit that - no i won’t that completely changes what i’m doing, i will not edit - well thank you for keeping this open and allowing me to take part - i feel good about it - i went back and edited the question mark out because i felt like i was ruining everything and not playing by the rules - wait you said try not to drown out the rest of the world - have i written too much - i am sorry - i think i wrote less than others though - maybe - hopefully - okay i’m going to stop here - goodbye - i miss writing this already and i hope you have a splendid day absurdity, the unexpected, all in chaos theory, universe and body one, basic elements to complex systems, we will not be able to predict,luckily, fear around, cross it over absurdity, the unexpected, all in chaos theory, universe and body one, basic elements to complex systems, we will not be able to predict,luckily, fear around, cross it over I come from Kythira, an island in southern Greece, i am visiting again after a long period in Denmark Its a bliss, the light is transparent, the colors so bright, even the storm that is about to arrive now in November 7th 2016 9.30 pm is going to be fully experienced as a bliss.The wind sings, i am with open doors ,i listen to a symphony.. its 2016 this has been going on for a long time, i wonder about the many lives who have contributed to this sentence Do they remember this? i have a new computer and because i heard a douglas davis lecture and learned about the sentence the computer decided it would like me to christen it by contributing to the sentence but in reality i am killing time waiting for someone to show up so i can go on to the next thing i have to do today even though i have the end of the day feeling and would like the next event not to happen so i shall think of pleasant things and here are the names of the dogs i have owned because they live in the moment even if some of them are dead and i just wanted their names to appear in the sentence HAPPY ASHLEY BECKETT SCOUT so i guess that’s their 15 nanoseconds of fame and i’m wondering now if there is a reader reading degree zero as fast as the sentence could be written that is all this reader could do sentenced to the sentence and the weird feeling that someone may have already written what i just wrote for the sentence what would be the odds but since it was reflexive of the sentence how does that affect the odds also once i had a rabbit well twice i had different rabbits but the one called DUSTIN died very young and i hardly knew him and the name of the other who lived long for a dutch dwarf was FUCKIN RABBIT becuase of a thing that happened with a car accident the day we got him, not his fault an argument kind of thing between self and now-ex-husband but anyway publicly his name was fred but at home we called him the other and it is amazing how you can say fuckin rabbit and it sounds sweet not violent and now i have to go to my next event the one i wished wasn’t but this was a good segue to it anyway oops He must behave or he will be restrained please, i see the beta fish in my left eye peripheral, is it a crawling roach on the wall? how many times will it surprise me and make me look sharply to the left? there are many knives just there to my right, at any moment i can plunge into the reincarnation, if, i believe enough please, i see the beta fish in my left eye peripheral, is it a crawling roach on the wall? how many times will it surprise me and make me look sharply to the left? there are many knives just there to my right, at any moment i can plunge into the reincarnation, if, i believe enough breathe hi we are still at lsu it was another cold and snow day in another American suburb and on the television was a movie about Leonardi the great inventor who was saying “Come on the light is being wasted” toute phrase est constructivement finie Hi from ITP kde kracal ten vzduch pritazov zaclon Hello he saod waiting for a reply that never came but i was lying down on my bed at the time feeling really ill whe they came and told me that my legs should not have fallen off like that but the leg wasnt listening and went ahead down the hill for ages last nigh but arms were not for him oh no, he was after some tentacles for his torso, and why shouldnt he after all he lives in ealing so why not eh billy what did you say I SAID ARMS ARE SO BORING It’s Hands that interest me why they can do anything, wave, feel, catch, even talk dammit i am sitting here with a lovely, brilliant digital designer from Tokyo whose name is best kept secret I look at her and my heart bursts with all possibilities with her; she excites me like other ever has and in her i see a future together which way to the zoo as I wonder if Joseph Beuys will be reading this sentence so if you are please call us or email us or just listen personal touch is now lost to the virtual, can u hold my hand?
